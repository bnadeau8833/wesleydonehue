203,"I Was A Teenage ""PIC""","For those of you not familiar with Bi-Lo, it’s a regional grocery store chain. I don’t include it in my Linkedin profile, but it was my first job in management. 

I was a PIC.

“Person-in-charge.”

I was 18 and the people I was in charge of were various ages; many of them older than I was. No matter, I wasn’t intimidated. There were shelves to stock and floors to sweep. And everyone has to do what the boss says.

That was me.

As impressive as Person-in-charge sounds (!), it was actually more like shift supervisor. I wasn’t the CEO of Bi-Lo. But I can tell you this:  when my bosses at Bi-Lo gave me something to do, I did it without delay, without complaining, without error and without asking a million questions. 

That’s good advice today ^ even if you don’t work at Bi-Lo. 

Get it done. Don’t do a victory dance. Instead, ask for something else to do. Your boss will notice. He or she will come to depend on you. And maybe, just maybe, one day you will be the person in charge.","For those of you not familiar with Bi-Lo, it’s a regional grocery store chain.

208,"I Just Ran 31 Miles and Learned Valuable Lessons For My Business, My Clients and My Life","I recently participated in the Palmetto 200—an endurance relay run from Columbia, South Carolina to Charleston, South Carolina. Yes, my team and I (six of us in all) took turns running nonstop from freakin’ Columbia to Charleston.

There was a time when that drive tired me out. Not now. That was the pre-running, pre-healthier Wesley. Let me tell you how I did it.

<strong>I SET A GOAL</strong>
Some friends of mine encouraged me last year to try the Palmetto 200. Consider that my friends historically have only encouraged me by saying things like “Just drink it, Wesley.” Maybe I am hanging around with a better crowd now. Anyway, I was intrigued by this challenge. I wanted to do it. There was only one problem.

I’m not a runner.

But if my goal was to not just enter, not just complete, but crush the Palmetto 200, I would have to become one. That led to step 2.

<strong>I MADE A PLAN</strong>
I talked to people who run and read some books by and about running to get some tips. I don’t think I had ever in my life run more than a mile or two at a time unless it was on a dare or a gym class. But that was all abut to change.

I made a plan for the year, and monthly plans, as well as daily plans. Little by little, I improved. More stamina, less hurt. But how was I doing really?

<strong>I TRACKED MY PROGRESS</strong>
I used MapMyRun and my Apple watch to record how often I was running and my pace and distance. And, as part of my plans, I studied the reports to see if any fine tuning was necessary.

<strong>I MET MY GOAL—AND SET ANOTHER ONE</strong>
Twelve of us ran last year. It takes more than 24 hours—you run, and then you rest and recover. But I saw other people I knew from Columbia running last year in teams of six—more running, less rest, whole team in one vehicle—and this year, I wanted to do that.

<strong>I MADE ADJUSTMENTS</strong>
I continued to run after last year’s Palmetto 200—including running my first marathon just a few months ago in Charleston. I also have been trying to live and eat healthier and I keep track of my diet and health information.

I started feeling fatigued at work and went to my nutritionist to help figure out why. Turns out I was eating so little meat and working out so much I actually had an iron deficiency. So I changed my diet and started taking supplements.

Problem solved.

<strong>I MET MY GOAL—AND SET ANOTHER ONE</strong>
So the six of us ran the Palmetto 200 last weekend. 31 miles is a lot of running. It’s an ultra marathon. Not bad for a non-runner.

I also participate in crazy GoRuck events—and am planning to go to an especially crazy one in June. Wait until you hear about that!

<strong>MY BUSINESS, MY CLIENTS, MY LIFE</strong>
You can’t get anywhere without a plan. You just can’t. And you certainly can’t lead if you don’t know where you’re going yourself. For Push Digital, for our clients, and for my life outside of work—a plan is a must.

I have been around a lot of businesses that issue regular reports and have regular staff meetings and, on a regular basis, nothing comes of either.

You have to monitor what’s going on with your plan—your sales goals, your fundraising goals, your brand awareness goals—on a regular basis, and be ready to change when something isn’t working, or to go all in if it is.

And we all have to, have to, have to keep an eye on the ultimate goal—whatever that might be. Victory. Profit. New product launch. A happy marriage. Mindfulness. Helping others. Your goal.

This works for me and I think it could work for you also. One way to find out!","I recently participated in the Palmetto 200—an endurance relay run from Columbia, South Carolina to Charleston, South Carolina.

212,"I've Read These Books And Think You Should, Too","I've been crushing books recently; about one a week for the last few months. Some I liked. Some I loved. Some were just kinda okay. I base a large chunk of my decisions on recommendations so I thought you might like to know what I thought of these books. Maybe you can find something awesome here.

Here are the books I've read in the last few months:

<strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/0062301233"">Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future by Ashlee Vance</a></strong>

I liked it. It gave me a lot of energy to hustle when I really needed it a few weeks back. It also scared me because, as much motivation as I have, I know I won’t be Elon Musk. This one also made me realize how small some of our work is. Wouldn’t it be nice to truly change the world? If you’re looking for a good biography, pick this one up.

<strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Way-SEAL-Think-Warrior-Succeed/dp/1621452115/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455293511&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+way+of+the+seal"">The Way of the SEAL: Think Like An Elite Warrior to Lead and Succeed by Mark Devine</a></strong>

I really liked it. As you can see from this list, I’ve been on quite the SEAL kick. They give me a lot of motivation to train for and endure GORUCK events. I found this one to be really good because, unlike a lot of other SEAL books, this one concentrates a lot on techniques rather than just saying “push through that shit.” I enjoyed the discussion on focus and meditation. I recommend this one to anyone training hard for a GORUCK event or marathon.

<strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/My-Year-Running-Dangerously-Ridiculous/dp/0399175474/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455293696&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=my+year+of+running+dangerously"">My Year of Running Dangerously: A Dad, a Daughter, and a Ridiculous Plan by Tom Foreman</a></strong>

I liked it. It's the story of a middle-aged DC reporter who gets back into running after many years because his college-aged daughter asked him to run a marathon with her. He did and then kept going, eventually tackling a 50-mile ultra. It's a great story about running and family. I recommend to all runners, especially older runners and beginners.

<strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Obstacle-Way-Timeless-Turning-Triumph/dp/1591846358/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455293764&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+obstacle+is+the+way"">The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph by Ryan Holiday</a></strong>

I really loved this book. It’s basically an introduction into Stoicism without having to read the ancient writings of Seneca or Marcus Aurelius. How do you stay calm and push through during times of adversity? How do you actually turn your obstacle into power? How do you take all the hard shit from life, learn from it and use it as the tool that helps you kick ass? That’s what this book is all about. I strongly recommend it to anyone going through a tough time, anyone training for a tough event and all entrepreneurs.

<strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Grit-Passion-Perseverance-Angela-Duckworth/dp/1501111108/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455294024&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=grit"">Grit: How to Keep Going When You Want to Give Up by Martin Meadows</a></strong>

It was just blah. This was a short book I picked up before my first marathon because I knew I would hit that wall and want to give up. It's not that it's a bad read, but after knocking out a few GORUCK events, I learned nothing new here. I would recommend to anyone who hasn't done an endurance event but is training for one.

<strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Badass-Doubting-Greatness/dp/0762447699/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455294088&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=you+are+a+badass"">You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life by Jen Sincero</a></strong>

I would say that I really liked it. I am close to loving it, but sometime found it hard to connect with the writer because she’s a woman. She does a great job of breaking down the norms everyone feels and the excuses they tell themselves about why they can’t be a badass and live the most awesome life ever. It’s a great life improvement book. I recommend it to everyone not already being a badass, which is like 98% of you.

<strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Sport-Business-Can/dp/1626810915/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455294412&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=How+to+Win+at+the+Sport+of+Business+by+Mark+Cuban"">How to Win at the Sport of Business: If I Can Do It, You Can Do It by Mark Cuban</a></strong>

Loved it. I read this short book in a day. Mark Cuban is just a badass and his stories made this a page turner. I recommend this one to all entrepreneurs.

<strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs/dp/1250067057/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455294760&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Extreme+Ownership"">Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin</a></strong>

Loved it. Two former Navy SEALS tell their war stories and then explain how lessons learned in battle can be used in business. I recommend this one to anyone as fascinated with SEALS as I am and to all entrepreneurs and managers.

<strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Martian-Andy-Weir/dp/0553418025/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455294495&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+martian"">The Martian by Andy Weir</a></strong>

Loved loved loved it! This is now one of my favorite books. You've probably seen the movie by now, which was phenomenal also. It did the book justice but, for time constraints, couldn't include much of the awesome detail. For those of you who haven't seen the movie, this is the story of an astronaut stranded on Mars alone after a failed mission. It's all about the human spirit and survival. It's also funny as hell. This isn't some science fiction nerd book. It just happens to be in space. I recommend it to every human.

<strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ultramarathon-Man-Confessions-All-Night-Runner/dp/1585424803/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455294527&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ultramarathon+man"">Ultramarathon Man: Confessions of an All-Night Runner by Dean Karnazes</a></strong>

This book was good. It's about Ultramarathon runner Dean Karnazes and his journey to become one of the world's elite long-distance runners. I liked it but didn't love it, mainly because I just don't like Karnazes as much as I like Scott Jurek. His attitude kinda rubs me the wrong way at times. Still, I recommend it to all runners.

<strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Living-SEAL-Training-Toughest-Planet/dp/1455534676/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455294669&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=living+with+a+seal"">Living with a SEAL: 31 Days Training with the Toughest Man on the Planet by Jesse Itzler</a></strong>

I loved this book. It's funny as shit! It's all about a successful young businessman who wants to shake up his life, so he invites a Navy SEAL to live with him for 31 days. This SEAL is an Ultramarathoner who holds the world record for pull-ups so, yeah, he's a badass. He spends a month putting the businessman through hell every day, tailing him everywhere he goes, including business meetings. I have to recommend this book to everyone, especially those who have become complacent in life as well as fitness types like my F3 brothers.

<strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Run-Unlikely-Ultramarathon-Greatness/dp/0544002318/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455296193&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=eat+and+run"">Eat and Run: My Unlikely Journey to Ultramarathon Greatness by Scott Jurek</a></strong>

I loved this book. Everyone who has read my favorite book, Born to Run, knows of Scott Jurek. He’s a badass ultra marathoner who accomplishes things that shouldn’t even be humanly possible. And he does it all on a vegan diet. This book is part biography and part cookbook. I strongly recommend it to all runners.

<strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Heart-Fist-Education-Humanitarian-Making/dp/0547750382/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455296440&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=eric+greitens"">The Heart and the Fist: The Education of a Humanitarian, the Making of a Navy SEAL by Eric Greitens</a></strong>

I liked it a lot. Here a Navy SEAL talks about his life and what led him to become a SEAL, where he learned that the world’s troubles cannot be solved with just strength. With strength and power, we must also show love. But unlike what a lot of liberals think, love alone will not fix the world. Love must be backed up by strength and the willingness to kick a little ass. I recommend this book to everyone.

<strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Resilience-Hard-Won-Wisdom-Living-Better/dp/054432398X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455296440&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=eric+greitens"">Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life by Eric Greitens</a></strong>

I liked it. Greitens’ second book is a list of letters for his buddy, another former Navy SEAL, who was down on his luck. Here, Greitens explains how to harness the power of resilience to push through the hard times and become a better person. I recommend this book to people who have ever been down on their luck.

<strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Finding-Ultra-Rejecting-Becoming-Discovering/dp/0307952207/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455296763&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=finding+ultra"">Finding Ultra: Rejecting Middle Age, Becoming One of the World's Fittest Men, and Discovering Myself by Rich Roll</a></strong>

I liked it, although I didn’t love it as much as I loved Jurek's book. I did like it more than I like Karnazes’ book. Rich Roll is another vegan ultra marathoner. He became famous after doing five ironman-distance triathlons on five islands of Hawaii in under a week. This book is about his journey from being a drug addict to being a badass, with a whole lot of veganism mixed in. I recommend this book to all runners.

<strong><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/What-About-Running-Vintage-International/dp/0307389839/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455296771&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=what+i+talk+about+when+i+talk+about+running"">What I Talk About When I Talk About Running by Haruki Murakami</a></strong>

It was okay. I didn’t love it as much as a lot of runners do. Here, Murakami tells little stories about his journey to long-distance running. Don’t get me wrong, it is a good book. But for some reason it just didn’t suck me in. It wasn’t a page turner. It’s just okay. However, I seem to be in the minority here as it appears on almost every list of ""must-read"" running books. So, I guess I recommend it for all runners.","My top reads!

220,"Marco Rubio's Digital Maestro","In 2016, a campaign can be made or broken in a single tweet.

So naturally there's an entire industry devoted to political digital strategy. Candidates can't be expected to post their own Instagrams, after all. It's what separates them from the rest of us.

""We handle online fundraising, graphic design, web development, social media,"" digital strategist and political consultant Wesley Donehue told CNN outside the Reed Awards and Conference, an event held annually to award and celebrate the best in campaign management, consulting and design.

Donehue is the CEO of Push Digital, a Charleston, South Carolina based, full service digital firm. Donehue and his team of about 25 people have worked on campaigns for elected office from the White House to city hall. Their biggest client is currently Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio.

""Basically it's handling all the day to day social media,"" Donehue said about the Florida senator's campaign. ""Helping organize a grassroots army on the Internet. And then the biggest thing we have to do right now is fundraising because it's expensive to run a campaign right now and a lot of the fundraising's happening online.""

Donehue, possibly the senator's biggest fan after his wife, has been with the campaign since the beginning. He even worked for Rubio's super PAC before Rubio's official campaign announcement last year. Rubio has outlasted a number of more experienced Republican candidates, coming in third in the Iowa caucuses and second in South Carolina Republican primary -- though he finished a distant fifth in the New Hampshire primary. Rubio's success has depended on his outreach, both in person and online.

""It's just really shocking to see all the hard work that Marco has put into it -- and the entire team -- like, come into reality,"" Donehue said. ""It's a lot of fun and it really just gets me going.""

The next chance to see how Donehue's strategy works for Rubio will be during Tuesday's Nevada caucuses.

232,"How To ""UnEff"" Your Mind","“Unfuck your mind. Today we’re going to concentrate on unfucking your mind,” Cousin screamed at us as we began our Saturday morning bootcamp workout. His intention was to spend the next hour making us carry as much heavy crap he could place on our shoulders, from point A to point B, to prove our limitations were mental and not physical. We hear all the time that “it’s as much mental as it is physical.” Sometimes we hear “it’s MORE mental than physical.” Yet, we spend all of our time getting our bodies ready and very little time getting our minds ready.

While this is typically the case for endurance events, it is not the case when a woman goes through training for a natural birth. For those gents who don’t know what that means, it’s giving birth with no pain medication. I can’t even imagine the pain. Through mental training, my wife beasted out our son with no medicine. I watched her eyes. I watched her breathing. It was the most amazing physical feat I’ve ever seen and it was nearly all mental. Since then I’ve been asking myself if she can do that through mental training and everyone says that endurance events are as much mental as physical, why aren’t we training mentally like she did?

I’m not a doctor, a psychologist or an experienced endurance athlete. I’ve run a marathon and an ultra-marathon relay in the last four months and have participated in six GORUCK events. This year I am training for a GORUCK HTL, one additional GORUCK Heavy, three additional GORUCK Toughs and two marathons in 2016. After a lot of research, I’m going to tell you how I’m approaching mental training every day. Because I’m currently doing this routine I cannot tell you about the results yet. I plan on following up frequently to let you know what’s working and what’s not working in the attempt to “unfuck my mind.”

You think differently from the common man or woman. On the outside they may look like you, but on the inside you’re very different. The mental preparation for the warrior mind-set allows you to dominate any challenge you accept in life:
<ul>
 	<li>Stay focused and relaxed, adaptable to the changing situation.</li>
 	<li>Know that you are going to succeed - there will be no wondering.</li>
 	<li>Tap into energy that lies deep inside you, allowing you to be capable of at least 20 times what you think you are.</li>
 	<li>Control fear and turn stress into success.</li>
 	<li>Keep goals very short, and be prepared for whatever comes your way.</li>
 	<li>Find humor in the challenge through a positive attitude that keeps you and your team motivated.</li>
 	<li>Be decisive and confident, a true leader.</li>

“Know the other and know the self, in a hundred battles you will be victorious; know the self but not other, in a hundred battles you will lose half. Know neither the self or the other, in a hundred battles you will lose all.” - SUN TZU

<em><strong>PURPOSE</strong></em>
What are you really supposed to do with your life? What is one thing you would focus on if you had nothing holding you back?

<em><strong>PASSION</strong></em>
Who are you? What makes you feel as if your hair's on fire? This informs your purpose when intersected with your skills and talents.

<em><strong>PRINCIPLES</strong></em>
What is it that you truly value? How can you “habituate” these values until you own them?” (Mark Divine, 8 Weeks To SEALFIT)

<strong>2. Goal Setting</strong>
I write a lot about goals. In summary, goals help you stay focused, ensure you are on the right track and are easily broken down into micro-goals that are easily consumable. Without goals, you float aimlessly through life, or in terms of physical feats, you float through events. For a marathon, the finish line is your goal, but set those mile, 5k and 10k micro goals for yourself. In a GORUCK event, set the movement and time hack as your micro goal. Crush those micro goals and give yourself something to celebrate and smile about during the suck. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/wesleydonehue?fref=ts"">Watch this video to learn more</a>

<strong>3. Mindfulness</strong>
Mindfulness is defined as “a mental state achieved by focusing one's awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one's feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations.” It’s a common theme throughout Buddhism. This skill allows you to stay calm in stressful situations. In terms of endurance events, I find it helps to reset the mind and concentrate on internal dialogue when in times of pain. It helps you zone out.

<strong>4. Positive Internal Dialogue</strong>
Talk to yourself. Don’t let the foo take over your mind. Tell yourself over and over that you can do it. Dr. Phil says, “Your internal dialogue powerfully programs and shapes your self-concept. If you believe you are worthy and strong, you will live up to that truth.” I tell myself to “stop being a little bitch and embrace the suck.” I also remind myself repeatedly that “when you think you’ve reached your maximum, you’ve really only reached 40% of your potential.”

<strong>5. Visualization</strong>
Without getting too in depth, visualization basically means visualizing something that isn’t there. It’s the ability to see it in your mind before it happens. In this case, visualizing success and seeing the finish line helps you get there. When something is miles or hours away, it’s hard to see an end. When it’s hard to see an end, it’s easy to quit. Visualization helps you see the end now, enabling you to keep pushing.

<strong>6. Breathing</strong>
If you can control breathing, you can control part of your nervous system. Controlling breathing can help you turn off what is known as the flight vs. fight response. What’s more, when you can control breathing, you can also be in control of your mind and body. Control breathing and help control your response to any external stimulus.

<strong>7. Pain Coping</strong>
All these techniques are meant to help you with pain, but let’s be honest - no matter what, you’re going to hurt. And that hurt is going to eventually take over. All the ibuprofen in your pocket isn’t going to eliminate all your pain, so it’s important to learn how to best deal with it. Habits are formed by repetition. Throughout your normal day you can find numerous opportunities to practice pain coping.

<strong>8. Motivation</strong>
Give yourself a reason for success. Find strength in others. Maybe it’s accomplishing a task to make yourself proud or maybe you are trying to prove something to someone else. It can be a religious or spiritual reason. Maybe it can be something historical. I’ll explain my motivations below.

<strong>9. Embrace The Suck</strong>
Find strength in the shitty. Find joy in pain. Use the heavy logs or the miles as your energy. Don’t just endure it. Embrace it. “Stoics had an art known as turning obstacles upside down. To act with ‘a reverse clause’, so there is always a way out or another route to get to where you need to go. So that setbacks or problems are always expected and never permanent. Making certain that what impedes us can empower us.” (Ryan Holiday, The Obstacle Is The Way).
Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote, ""Our actions may be impeded but there can be no impeding our intentions or dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt, the mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.""

<em><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">My Daily Routine</span></strong></em>

<strong>1. Meditation (skills: mindfulness, breathing, visualization, 3 P’s)</strong>
Meditation is a practice where an individual trains the mind or induces a mode of consciousness, either to realize some benefit or for the mind to simply acknowledge its content without becoming identified with that content, or as an end in itself.

The term meditation refers to a broad variety of practices that include techniques designed to promote relaxation, build internal energy or life force and develop compassion, love, patience, generosity and forgiveness. A particularly ambitious form of meditation aims at effortlessly sustained single-pointed concentration meant to enable its practitioner to enjoy an indestructible sense of well-being while engaging in any life activity.<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation""> (wiki: meditation)</a>

On top of all that, meditation helps me zone out, which I find particularly important during an endurance event so I’m not concentrating on my pain. It enables me to be somewhere else, somewhere internal. Daily meditation is a non-negotiable for me, meaning it’s something I absolutely will do every single day no matter what. I find it to be the most important item on this list.

I suggest using the <a href=""https://www.headspace.com/"">Headspace app</a>, but there are many good ones in the various app stores.

<strong>2. Box Breathing (skills: breathing, mindfulness, pain coping)</strong>
“Begin to take control of your breathing. Later, this will allow you to control fear and stress and maintain a calm body and mind. SEALs call it arousal control. Simply start by exhaling all the air from your lungs, then breathing slowly into your belly to a count of 4. Hold your breath to a count of 4. Then exhale to a count of 4, expelling all the air at the end. Finally, hold your lungs empty for a count of 4. The 4-4-4-4 count is a box, hence the name of this drill. Do this breathing exercise before your training for a least 5 minutes.” (Mark Divine, 8 Weeks To SEALFIT)

<strong>3. Wim Hof Method (skills: breathing, mindfulness, pain coping, motivation, positive internal dialogue)</strong>
Wim Hoff is an absolutely insane Dutchman known for his ability to withstand extreme cold. He holds more than 20 world records and has done some things that just shouldn’t be possible, including:

-Completing a full marathon in the polar circle with temperatures close to -4 F. He was dressed in nothing but shorts.
-He holds the Guinness World Record for the longest ice bath at nearly 2 hours.
-He climbed Mount Everest wearing nothing but shorts.
The list goes on and on. Through his <a href=""http://wimhofmethod.com/"">Wim Hoff Method</a>, consisting of breathing techniques, meditation, stretching and cold shower training, Wim teaches people how to tap into their autonomic nervous systems to control immune responses.

Yes, that all sounds insane. I’ve been doing it for a few weeks and already I have more energy, I can hold my breath for two minutes and I can withstand much more time in a cold shower. I believe this method will help me cope with pain during endurance events. I also hear that it’s mighty frigid in the English Channel. This should help.

<strong>4. Morning ritual</strong>
a. Review all long-term goals, quarterly, weekly and daily goals. (skills: goal setting, 3 P’s, motivation)
<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/wesleydonehue/videos/vb.12611392/10103895020659297"">Click here to learn more </a>
b. Pray (skills: mindfulness, 3 P’s, internal positive dialogue)
c. Visualize success(skills: visualization, 3 P’s, motivation, goal setting)

Every day I sit for five minutes with my eyes closed, visualizing what success in my life looks like. Every day is different and sometimes I concentrate on one aspect of my life more than others. I concentrate on family, financial, business, physical, spiritual and relationship success.

After five minutes of visualization, I read the following from Napoleon Hill’s Think and Grow Rich. Please know that this visualization (and auto-suggestion) technique works specifically for me and my line of work, and may not for you. I encourage you to find something that works for you.

The application of this (auto-suggestion) principle is made through a simple arrangement of positive thought impulses stated in writing, memorized, and repeated until they become a part of the working equipment of the subconscious faculty of your mind.

<strong>FIRST.</strong>
I know that I have the ability to achieve the object of my Definite Purpose in life, therefore, I DEMAND of myself persistent, continuous action toward its attainment, and I here and now promise to render such action.
<strong>SECOND.</strong>
I realize the dominating thoughts of my mind will eventually reproduce themselves in outward, physical action, and gradually transform themselves into physical reality, therefore, I will concentrate my thoughts for thirty minutes daily, upon the task of thinking of the person I intend to become, thereby creating in my mind a clear mental picture of that person.
<strong>THIRD</strong>.
I know through the principle of auto-suggestion, any desire that I persistently hold in my mind will eventually seek expression through some practical means of attaining the object back of it, therefore, I will devote ten minutes daily to demanding of myself the development of SELF-CONFIDENCE.
<strong>FOURTH.</strong>
I have clearly written down a description of my DEFINITE CHIEF AIM in life, and I will never stop trying, until I shall have developed sufficient self-confidence for its attainment.
<strong>FIFTH.</strong>
I fully realize that no wealth or position can long endure, unless built upon truth and justice, therefore, I will engage in no transaction which does not benefit all whom it affects. I will succeed by attracting to myself the forces I wish to use, and the cooperation of other people. I will induce others to serve me, because of my willingness to serve others. I will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism, by developing love for all humanity, because I know that a negative attitude toward others can never bring me success. I will cause others to believe in me, because I will believe in them, and in myself.

I will sign my name to this formula, commit it to memory, and repeat it aloud once a day, with full FAITH that it will gradually influence my THOUGHTS and ACTIONS so that I will become a self-reliant, and successful person.

Yes, this exercise is primary about wealth, but my goals go far beyond wealth so this formula helps me envision all goals, including physical goals, as accomplished through auto-suggestion.

<strong>5. Evening ritual (skills: 3 P’s, goal setting, motivation, internal positive dialogue, mindfulness)</strong>
Review all goals. Cross off every to do accomplished. Track all daily to dos in an app so they can be reviewed for long term tracking. Determine what went right and what went wrong today. Figure out why some items on the to do list were not crossed off and decide what can be done tomorrow to better accomplish the missions at hand. Create tomorrow’s to do list. Pray and thank God for today’s accomplishments.

<strong>6. Pain Coping (skills: pain coping, breathing, mindfulness, internal positive dialogue, embracing the suck)</strong>
I got this one from my wife’s birth training. Start by holding an ice cube in your hand for 60 seconds at a time. Then every week progress up 30 seconds. I’m now at three minutes. You wouldn’t think that holding ice sucks, but man, it hurts. While holding the ice, practice your other skills including breathing, visualization, positive internal dialogue, mindfulness and embracing the suck.

<strong>7. Read / Watch something motivational (skills: motivation)</strong>
I believe you can find a lot of strength in others. Identify people or stories that prove your goal can be accomplished. Concentrate every single day on those items so that you are auto-suggesting to yourself that the feat is possible. The body is nowhere near as weak as it feels.

Before GORUCK Tough events, I read a lot of Navy SEAL books and always watch Lone Survivor (make sure to read the book too as it goes into a lot more detail). If Marcus Luttrell can survive being shot up to hell in the Hindu Kush, I can get a damn railroad tie five miles. As stated above, when you think you’ve hit your maximum, you’ve only really reached 40% of your potential.

Currently I’m reading and watching a lot about D-Day because I’m preparing for the Normandy GORUCK. I watched Saving Private Ryan last weekend and am currently reading D-Day by Stephen Ambrose. How can I quit on a beach where thousands of Americans died? That’s motivation.

<strong>8. Read Stoicism (skills: mindfulness)</strong>
ESPN recently published an article entitled “How a book on stoicism became wildly popular at every level of the NFL” about Ryan Holiday’s The Obstacle Is The Way. They explain why a book about Greek philosophy is being read, not just by football players, but by athletes across the country. They explain stoicism and sports much better than I can:

The answer, at its most basic level, is this: Athletes and the people who coach them may be unfamiliar with stoicism, but they are stoics. They endure pain or hardship without feeling or complaint. They control what they can control. They talk ad nauseam about controlling only what they can control. They’re on to Cincinnati. They stay in the moment, and take things one game at a time. And by doing that, they are voicing a philosophy—living a philosophy, training under a philosophy—without knowing of or understanding it.

“Stoicism as a philosophy is really about the mental game,” Holiday said. “It’s not a set of ethics or principles. It’s a collection of spiritual exercises designed to help people through the difficulty of life. To focus on managing emotion; specifically, non-helpful emotion.”
I’m currently reading Seneca’s Letters from a Stoic. Earlier I posted a quote by Emperor Marcus Aurielious - he was one of the most famous stoics.

<strong>9. Do Yoga (skills: mindfulness, breathing)</strong>
Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice or discipline which originated in India. You’re probably thinking of it as something women do on a mat because they don’t want to get dirty. But that’s not even close to true. Mark Divine says yoga is vital for durability, core development, balance and detoxifying. In the case of mental preparedness, it’s important for concentration development, tapping into your inner energy and practicing your breathing techniques.

Yoga is not currently in my routine but will be starting next week.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Where To Begin</strong></span>
Before you begin any of this, I want to encourage you to do the following:
1. Determine your purpose.
2. Determine your passion.
3. Determine your principles.
4. Determine your goals.
5. Break your goals down into micro goals.
6. Find a good book or something that will motivate you.
5. Download a meditation app.
6. Schedule your day to include all the techniques listed that you believe will be beneficial.

302,"If Your Campaign Is Just Using Robocalls And Billboards...","We had a lead the other day on a client who politely declined our services saying, “We’re just running robocalls and billboards.” Excuse me? Is this 2016, or 1996? Maybe you should spend the extra bucks and buy a few spots on “Melrose Place” while you’re at it.

I couldn’t believe it. Robocalls are the most intrusive, annoying tool you could possibly use. It’s not a bad “call” if your objective is to totally piss people off to the max, because you will. That is, what few people you can find who still have a landline.

Robocalls. It was mind blowing.

And billboards? I couldn’t even be convinced people would notice the HOLLYWOOD sign in LA or the gigantic digital displays in New York City’s Times Square, let alone a billboard for a candidate.

It’s the most unsophisticated, ass-backward campaign I’ve heard about. And it’s not the way to market today. Today, you want to use data to help you create amazing content that is native to the platform and that people like.

I have two pieces of advice:

One, if you are just running robocalls and billboards for your campaign, you don’t know what in the hell you’re doing. And, two—if your opponent is just running robocalls and billboards, start shopping for office furniture.

304,"The Single Biggest Mistake In Digital Advocacy","I am currently leading the IE work for a state legislative caucus. In this role, my responsibility is primarily to help the majority leader maintain (and build) the party’s majority.

I’ve been spending that last few days pouring through polling cross tabs—breaking down answers to the same questions by different demographic groups. And what’s not shocking at all is that different demographics feel differently about particular issues.

The point of this is quite simple: everybody is different.

But groups doing advocacy work don’t always consider that. I’m not sure why—because they don’t know how? Because they don’t want to? Because it’s more complicated? Because they’re lazy?

We do our work at Push based on data. The polling cross tabs are a great example. Because even when we have the same or a similar message, we will communicate to different groups with different language or on a different platform based on what we know. And based on what they want.

What I often see on Facebook are advocacy campaigns that are like a billboard on the highway—the exact same message and platform for everyone.

At Push, we start with data. Why would you not? That’s how we push a targeted message to a targeted audience. And how we get results.

We use all of that data (voter info, internet habits, etc.) to develop creative for specific demographic groups. Then we also use data to drive that creative to specific demographic groups. And then we get more data about performance so we can see how well things are working and can fine-tune the creative or the delivery method as needed.

Don’t make the single biggest mistake in digital advocacy. Use data. Data is your friend. Data is your ally. Take data out for coffee.","Don't make this mistake. Use data.

315,"I Finally Did What People Have Been Telling Me To Do For Years... I Took A Hike","Even though I run a digital marketing firm, I feel the need to unplug now and then. So when the idea of men’s hiking weekend came up at church, I said, “Hell yeah!” (Actually, it was church—so I just said, “yes.” But enthusiastically.)

And, yes—I heard all the jokes. “How many times have people suggested you take a hike, Wesley???” OK, more than once.

But this was a great way to do several things. One, really unplug (no cellphones). Two, combine things that I like (being outdoors and exercise). Three, combine other things I like (praying and getting to know my church brothers better).

Four days in the North Carolina wilderness. Peaceful. Beautiful. Practically no cell service.*
Lots of hiking. Lots of thinking. Lots of quiet.

What did I learn? It’s important to disconnect. You can clear your mind. You need to. We all need to. We walk around with our heads stuck in phones or stuck looking at TV monitors. I don’t think your brain can function properly when you are constantly consuming information.

When your brain is less cluttered, you can think more clearly. You can think bigger picture thoughts. That’s what I did. I thought about my family. And I thought about my business.

I also learned I need to do this more often. The last time I had a few days like this was before
our beautiful son was born (he just turned two). It’s a luxury to be able to go but it’s like Date Night. You have to find the time. You’ll be better for having done it.

*Full disclosure—I did take my phone. Just turned it on a few times. Made sure things were OK at home and told my wife I love her. Also checked in at work. In that order.

And if you feel a little overwhelmed at work or at home, do what I did. Take a hike.","Even though I run a digital marketing firm, I feel the need to unplug now and then.

317,"No One's Listening .... But They're Watching","According to several publishers whose videos are among the billions of views on Facebook each day, as much as 85 percent of those videos are watched with no sound. No music. No voiceover. No sound effects.

We had an idea this was true, and so we prepared a video to work well with no sound (even though it has a great music track and SFX) several months ago. It was the lead video for a big announcement from our client SeaWorld.

Advertisers seem to have adapted (at least with videos that were made specifically for this platform) and their agencies believe that, generally, the muted videos work equally well as ones experienced with sound.

Content producers may mourn the loss in these instances (after all, that is half of audio-visual), but accept the reality of the way many people watch videos on Facebook.

This doesn’t mean—to us, at least—that sound is dead. It’s just another way of staying ahead of the curve. This is how/when/where/and why a lot of people are consuming media plan accordingly.

321,"I'm Going To Normandy On The Anniversary Of D-Day To Get My Ass Kicked In The Sand","I’m here at Push this week—but after that I’m on a two-week “vacation.” Actually, for the first week, I’m going to be beaten to a pulp in a foreign country. Then my wife and son and I will spend a week in Paris. 

Allow me to explain. 

I have been participating in GoRuck events for a while now.  For those of you who don’t know, GoRuck was started by a veteran of the U.S. Special Forces (Green Berets) and is “based in every way” on the lessons learned in training and in war. Originally conceived to market a class-leading ruck sack (backpack), the company began endurance events to test the durability of the “rucks.” These also tested the durability the participants, which led to more events, which led to today. 

I have participated in seven GoRuck events, but nothing like this one. This one is actually three events back-to-back:  a Light event (5+ hours), a Tough event (12+ hours) and a Heavy event (24+ hours). And they take place on the two beaches the Americans stormed on June 6, 1944—Omaha and Utah. That’s hallowed land. We will also be in Colleville-sur-Mer, the location of the American cemetery and memorial. Again, hallowed land. 

So what I signed up for will be painful, and will last 47 hours; give or take. I wanted to make sure, when I signed up for something like this, that the location would be in a place where  I knew I wouldn’t quit. How could I?

It’s the anniversary of one of the greatest days in US history.

It’s the location of an event that changed he world. 

I will think of all the people who fought and died there. What their families went through. I will think of the wounded. The innocent French civilians. The destruction. The price paid for freedom—almost impossible to calculate, even after all these years. 

The least I can give is my very best.","I’m here at Push this week—but after that I’m on a two-week “vacation.” Actually, for the first week, I’m going to be beaten to a pulp in a foreign country.

323,"Why I Decided To Focus On My Health In The First Place","I was never in horrible physical shape (at least, I didn’t think I was) but after college I did work on a lot of political campaigns. Ask anyone who has—that’s a lot of pizza, a lot of beer, a lot of late nights. But what the heck? I was in my 20’s. Indestructible.

About two and a half years ago, I decide to get a check-up. Maybe it was because my firstborn was on way.

I’m not sure what was on my mind. But I remember this part--my doctor had not seen a blood pressure reading as high as mine in anyone my age. I know what was on my mind then:

“Wake-up call for Mister Donehue.”

My parents died young. My mother was 48 when she passed, and my father was 57. Do the math. Average it out. I’m looking at 52?

My parents led unhealthy lifestyles (that’s a topic for another blog), which didn’t help. But, still; they were pretty young. So I decided to do something about it. I started exercising.

I had heard about this group called F3. That stands for Fitness, Fellowship and Faith. I’m good with all three. The group started in North Carolina and there was an F3 group in Columbia, SC where I was, so I joined. It’s a group of guys who get together for non-professional, volunteer-led workouts several times a week. It took a while, but I did start to feel like it was making a difference. Because of the Fellowship, you encourage and push each other to do one more push up or one more lap, and it works. I had done just about zero running, and started thinking about races once fitness became part of my routine.

Long story short, I ran my first (but not last) marathon this year, and am just about to head to Normandy where I (and one of my F3 brothers) will “invade” the beaches on the anniversary of D-Day. It’s a multi-day, multi-hour endurance event. It should be intense.

In addition to exercising and running and endurance events, I am really careful about what I eat. And I get the proper amount of sleep. I do breathing exercises. I meditate.

Will I live to be 100? Time will tell. But I will be in good enough shape to. Count on that.","My doctor had not seen a blood pressure reading as high as mine in anyone my age.

336,"It's Going To Hurt But I'm Not Being Shot At","<em><strong> GORUCK Normandy HTL AAR, Part 1</strong></em>

I woke up from my midday nap with boundless nervous energy. This would be the last real sleep for the next three days.Three days of intense physical and mental stress where sleep is the only real cure and one of many things I can’t have. I got up, already dressed for the first event, put on my hat and grabbed an espresso. Then it was to the already-packed car for the 32-minute drive to Utah Beach, Normandy.

I had participated in six previous GORUCK events; four Toughs and two Lights. This trip was supposed to be my first Heavy. Then Cadre Dan posted on Facebook how we should do all three events back-to-back—the Heavy, the Tough and the Light (known as HTL)—because we are flying all the way to France, because all three events will be in different locations and because all three events would concentrate on different parts of the Normandy invasion. How could I argue with three becauses? So my first Heavy attempt became my first HTL attempt.

Let's pause for a second and explain all this to you folks who have no clue what I'm talking about. GORUCK is a company founded and run by ex-military special forces guys (FYI not much emphasis on the “ex”). They sell amazing gear and put on endurance events in which you have to wear 30 pounds of weight in your ruck (backpack) the entire time. They beat you down with a mix of PT and long hikes while carrying a ton of heavy shit like sandbags, utility poles, cinder blocks or whatever else they can find on the side of the street. The whole purpose is to turn you and everyone who showed up into a team who can operate seamlessly to accomplish missions. It's painful. It sucks. It pushes you to your most extreme physical and mental limits. And it's awesome. For me personally, GORUCK has shown me who I really am. It's built my confidence by showing me that I can do much more than I think I can. It's also taught me how to function as a teammate and operate as a team leader, which I have taken back to Push. I'll explain more in a future blog post.

GORUCK has three main events. The 24-hour Heavy, the 12-hour Tough and the 5-hour Light. This event would be all three back-to-back-to- back with a four-hour break in between each. That's 41 hours if we don't go over. With the breaks we are talking about 50 freaking hours from beginning to end.

My nerves were on edge and doubt filled my mind. I hadn't prepared for the cold. It's nearly 90 degrees in Charleston. It should be 90 degrees in Northern France too, right? Yeah, real smart, Wesley.

My pack was too heavy. I knew Elizabeth would be there at the end of the Heavy to resupply us, but I still had 24 hours and I would be burning a shit ton of calories. Food = fuel. 30 pound ruck plate (weight), food, full water bladder, hoodie, jacket, extra socks and gloves, headlamp, extra batteries, glasses in case my contacts fell out and the required identification and 20 euros in case we had to cab home. That's it. I knew I was pushing 50 pounds and I had never gone above 40 for an event. Fuck a duck! Freezing cold + too much weight = psyched-out Wesley.

<img class=""size-full wp-image-338 alignright"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_2659.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2659"" width=""400"" height=""533"" />

I closed my eyes and meditated for 10 minutes in the backseat of the car while Elizabeth drove, Hotspot sat in the passenger seat and Harlowe chilled beside me in his car seat watching Curious George on his iPad. ""Unfuck your mind,"" I kept repeating to myself over and over. ""You're ready.""

Training began months prior as soon as I finished the Charleston marathon in January. I was in good shape, but I had hit my lowest weight since college by eating mostly vegan and running 40 miles a week. Let's be honest. This body was made to run, not to carry heavy shit. I'm not a pack mule and, unfortunately, GORUCK events are perfect for pack mules. My skinny, weak ass wasn't anywhere prepared so my first goal was to begin weight lifting three days a week. I also changed my diet and began pounding meat. I stopped running and began rucking three bootcamps a week and rucking in the evenings and on weekends. All totaled I was working out about ten times each week, which I took down to about seven after getting really sick twice and realizing I was crushing my body. I also began mental training. I started meditating every day and began the Wim Hoff Method. I inundated my mind with Normandy and other WWII content, including books, TV shows, documentaries, movies and podcasts. I drove my wife nuts for about three months. The stories of those badass men would be my fuel.

We arrived at the Utah Beach Museum where we visited the day before. About ten others were already there with their rucks lined up for the initial inspection. There's no turning back now. We trained for months. We flew all the way to France and trained over to Normandy. One last bathroom stop and twenty minutes of introductions as more ruckers filed in. The cadre showed up and told us to get in four ranks. I gave Elizabeth and Harlowe a final kiss. I hugged Hotspot and said, ""Do not let me quit."" He replied, ""We got this, baby.""

I lined up and looked at the beach. Today I'm going to get my ass kicked into the sand. But I won't be running out of a Higgins boat with Nazi machine guns aimed at me. I won't be jumping out of an airplane, floating down to Earth helplessly as target practice for a Nazi solider. It's time to stop being a little bitch. It's going to hurt but I won't die or get seriously injured as so many did RIGHT HERE where I stand. I will not dishonor them by quitting. It's go time. Let's roll.

344,"Walking Through Blood-Stained Fields","<h2><em>GORUCK Normandy HTL AAR, Part 2</em></h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">""You mother fucker"" is what I said out loud, but quietly, as the guy in front of me dumped out his grocery bag. It was a ruck, but the thing was full of loose food and candy that scattered across the cement when the cadre ordered us to empty our rucks. ""That son of a bitch just got us punished big time,” I said to Hotspot. He just shook his head in reply. There's no way the cadre is going to give him all day to get that mess back together.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The event was led by four cadre. Cadre Dan is in the Army Special Forces and is one of the most intense cadre I had experienced previously; rarely seen without a cigarette and a Monster energy drink. He led the Greenville event that I nearly dropped from because I was so sick. I got home and had a temp of 102. I hated every minute with Dan.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>It's also noteworthy that he created the Heavy event. Cadre Heath, also in the Army Special Forces, led our Myrtle Beach event, which was the hardest ass-whooping I've had to date. Despite kicking my teeth in, he's my favorite cadre I've had because he took a lot of time to tell us amazing stories in between our beatings. Also joining was Cadre Mickey, a force recon Marine and Cadre Mocha Mike, Army Special Forces. This was my first event with both. Cadres Dan and Mickey led the first half of the event while </span><span class=""s1"">Heath and Mocha Mike led the last half.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We started with admin. The cadre introduced themselves and took roll. Then they made us empty out our rucks and hold up our weight, water, id/money individually. We were given 30 seconds to get our rucks back together. Yeah, I called that one.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Obviously the grocer didn't get his ruck back together, along with a few other unorganized Blue Falcons, a military term meaning ""buddy fucker."" It's what we call a guy who screws over a teammate or the entire team. Most of the time it's unintentional like the grocer. He didn't mean to and I'm sure he felt like an ass. But there's also the common ""gray man"" who tries to blend in and not be seen so that he/she doesn't have to carry heavy shit.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We were told to sprint, with rucks, across a field. Wanting to prove myself right out of the gate, I quickly took the lead and got back to our position before anyone else. I'm definitely not the strongest but I could be the fastest. There aren't many opportunities to prove that. We were given 30 more seconds to get rucks put together and then another run. Rinse and repeat three more times and finally everyone got their shit together.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>We grabbed our flags and our coupons (a few sandbags) and headed to the Higgins boat monument.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Long story short, the Higgins boat is the one you've seen in all the pictures taking men to shore. Built in New Orleans, it was the workhorse in numerous WWII theaters. These boats became an important theme in all three events.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Next it was to the beach where Cadre Dan drew out a sand map and explained how the Normandy invasion went down. I won't go into detail here because it would require a few more pages of writing. For now just know that we were on Utah Beach where things went a little better for the American forces and we would spend most of the evening concentrating on the airborne rangers who parachuted in with the 82nd and 101st.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">At this point I was really hoping for a PT test which they did last year. It's a five mile run in forty-five minutes and as many push-ups and sit-ups as possible in two minutes. None of that's a problem for me and I would probably lead the pack on the run. But luck was not on my side. It was straight to all the shit I hate.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">We spent the next forever bounding and doing high crawls, low crawls, buddy bear crawls, buddy drags and fireman carries across the beach like we were being shot at. The low crawls particularly sucked because we weren't allowed to lift our heads off the sand, at all. For the first workout in years I actually threw up but caught it in my mouth and swallowed quickly. ""Oh shit! It's way too early for this,"" I said to myself.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>I'm not sure if Eric, who was also attempting the HTL, saw the hard swallow, but he obviously saw my face because he started pushing me hard as our faces dug into the sand. I needed it.</span>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-350 alignright"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_2668.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2668"" width=""400"" height=""300"" /></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">""You have 30 seconds to line up according to height,"" Cadre Dan yelled. Then he put us in the shape of Higgins boats and told us to face the water. Here we go. The part I've been dreading for weeks. We went in up to our waists and started bobbing up and down as the cadre splashed freezing water on us. The door dropped, so to speak, and we stormed the beach, dropping to high crawl position as we hit the water line. My 50 pound ruck suddenly felt like 100 while full of water. I crawled and crawled and crawled. ""Damn, thank God that's over,"" I said to someone. Yeah, right.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>Rinse and repeat a couple more times, but with low crawls, face straight in the mud.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Just when we thought we were done we were told to high crawl through this makeshift obstacle course up and down dunes for what seemed like forever. Not gonna lie. I was struggling at this point and pulling up the rear. I couldn't stop shaking and I honestly thought I had hypothermia. Maybe I did, but I just kept going anyway. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Sometime before we left the beach we filled up a big duffle bag with sand. It was strapped down to a litter with no poles so that four people could carry it at a time. This ""pig""'would become my worst enemy later in the event. For now I grabbed a sandbag and took the first steps in our 40-mile trek.</span></p>
<img class=""size-full wp-image-351 alignleft"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_2669.jpg"" alt=""IMG_2669"" width=""400"" height=""300"" />
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is a good time to tell you that the order of events here could be wrong. Believe it or not, they didn't give us time to take notes. Also, I'm not going to tell you every single stop we made and exercise we did. There's just too much to remember and after about 20 hours my brain took a long ride on the struggle bus.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The first stop was just a couple miles down the road to the momentum of Major Dick Winters. I was very pumped about this one because I had just watched HBO's Band of Brothers and he was the lead character, the pipe-hitting badass in charge of Easy Company that parachuted into Normandy on D-day. Their exploits are legendary.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Let's talk about the airborne for a minute because for the purpose of knowing how our night went, you need to know two things. First off, they were scattered all over the place. It was a major D-day fuck up. The bad weather caused a low cover. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Also, there were a ton of pilots who had no combat experience. The result was a bunch of freaked out pilots who flew too high, flew too low and flew too fast without being able to see shit except explosions. That meant our airborne operation was almost a complete failure. Secondly, the airborne were charged, in part, with taking infrastructure. The little towns, roads and bridges meant supply flow. The Nazi’s couldn't send reinforcements without infrastructure and we couldn't get inland without infrastructure. So guess what we did? We visited a whole lot of little towns, bridges and roads. And by visited, I mean we walked hours with a ton of heavy shit. When we arrived, we did exercises that taught us military movements. Frankly, it was badass as hell, but I don't remember them all.</span></p>
What I do remember:
<ol>
 	<li>We only missed one time hack and was punished with PT in Ste-Marie-du-Mont.</li>
 	<li>We stopped in Vierville, Come-du-Mont, Carentan (furthest south and half way point) and Chef-du-Pont.</li>
 	<li>We stopped at three extremely important bridges where we practiced how to take the bridges and parachute landings. I wish I could remember them but I was mentally cooked. I was just trying to do what I was told without screwing up.</li>
</ol>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Those three points I just glazed over took well over fifteen hours and totaled over 30 miles, so yeah, it was absolutely brutal. My feet became blistered and fatigue set in numerous times. I caught my second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth winds, only to be defeated by the 60 pound sandbag I almost never let go.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>Throughout the night I tried to just meditate while walking and remove my mind from the situation. Many times my teammates tried taking my sandbag, commenting that my eyes said I was done. The truth is I was trying to zone out.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">My back held up better than expected, given my years of trouble after a fun night in a Dallas hospital. My feet were my biggest enemy. At every opportunity I dropped to my hands and knees just to get a few seconds off my feet. ""Are you okay?” I was asked all night long. I was fine. I just need 10 seconds, any seconds, off my damn feet. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We marched through towns, by beautiful churches, on roads, on trails and beside fields where so many paratroopers landed. They walked right here. They fought right here. They killed right here. Many died right here. Every single time I felt pain I just looked out and thought how this land in which I walk was stained with the blood of heroes. They were just normal American boys, like me, from every corner of America. Somehow they ended up across an ocean to liberate a continent from an evil regime. One day they were just being American teenagers and then they were jumping out of airplanes while getting shot at. Never have I realized how absolutely fucking entitled we are until I looked out across those fields. In just 70 years we've gone from the greatest generation to the crybaby generation.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I carried my sandbag all night, eventually getting into rotations with Hotspot and others so I could get short two-minute breaks. Every so often I ran up to the front and got on the pig. We carried it half the event “farmer style,” letting our forearms do the work. Eventually the team found two long sticks and ran them through the litter, allowing us to carry the pig on our shoulders. With somewhere around six hours left in the event, I decided it was time to up my game and to leave it all out on the field. I got on that pig and really never got off for the rest of the Heavy. We had a rotation with two teams, four men on each team. One team would carry for a few minutes, on their shoulders, and then the other team would jump on. It worked well and we were moving like a well-oiled machine. Everyone hurt like hell but we weren't missing any more time hacks.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Eventually we made it to a field outside of Ste- Mere- Eglise where we took a short break at the Airborne monument. Here we had to take everything we were taught and blow up a bridge with our explosives, also known as our coupons. Oh, I forgot to tell you that coupons are all the heavy shit we had to carry all night. We got into our squads and low crawled beside the hedges for cover. Our teammates provided cover fire as we dragged our explosives into position. As I said, that pig was mine, so I and three others got that heavy son of a bitch to the bridge. The entire team got back into position behind a hill and we set off the explosives with a huge BOOM. Mission accomplished. Those damn Nazi tanks aren't coming this way.</span></p>

<center><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/oxbBcRDUEHU"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></center>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We put all the coupons, except for the flags, into the cadre's car and then took the 2-mile trek into Ste- Mere-Eglise where we stopped at the church were John Steele parachuted in, got stuck on the steeple and played dead for hours despite being shot.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>A statue with parachute now hangs from the church to commemorate Steele's badassery. We were given a few minutes to explore the church. I stared up at the stained glass window showcasing the paratroopers. I sat in a church pew and thanked God for allowing me to finish my first Heavy. I asked for strength to get me through the next two events. ""Please God, help me get back out of bed,"" I prayed.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>Just a few minutes earlier, before entering the church, I saw Elizabeth and Harlowe waiting for me. My eyes filled with tears.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We got back into formation outside the church where we were quizzed about what we were taught. Wrong answers resulted in push-ups and flutter kicks.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>Huge American military planes preformed flyovers above the church while we did PT. I cried again.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I was given my patch and a hug by all four cadre. I walked over to Elizabeth and said, ""I earned every single stitch of this patch."" I did. I performed well. I was a great teammate. I carried my load. And I hurt like hell.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>24 hours and 40 miles. It was less PT than I would have thought. It was also more mileage and a lot more heavy shit than I would have imagined. It was painful, but the history lessons and just being in Normandy occupied my mind so that I didn't just concentrate on the pain. Also, our team really gelled together and I found myself really enjoying their company. Only two people dropped. They were a couple, who I believe were Dutch. They were the only people I've ever seen smoke during an event, aside from Cadre Dan, and if you would have forced me to pick two people who would drop, it would have been them.</span></p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">""I know this wasn't the plan, but Hotspot and I need a hot shower. Please get us home as fast as possible."" My amazing wife had lunch waiting for us in the car. It was the best sandwich and chips I had ever had.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>Aside from my wife, my flip flops were the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Elizabeth rushed us 40 minutes down the road back to Bayeux. We only had three hours until the next event on Omaha Beach. We took hot showers and then got into the bed with alarms set to wake us up in one hour. I fell immediately to sleep. ""The hardest part of a HTL is showing back up for the Tough,"" we were told by everyone. </span></p>

358,"225 Went Into The Fight And Only 95 Made It Out","<h2><em>GORUCK Normandy HTL AAR, Part 3</em></h2>
""Get up. It's been an hour,"" Elizabeth said gently but firmly. ""You're going. Get up."" Just about then my alarm went off. I immediately felt the pain in my upper back, which was odd because it's my lower back that's given me trouble since my big injury three years ago. I stepped out of bed and... oh yeah, there it is. ""My fucking feet are on fire,"" I barked. ""Tell me what you need and let's roll,"" she replied. Hot damn, my wife is badass.

Elizabeth had washed and dried my clothes while I was sleeping. Everything was like new again accept for my wet boots, sandy ruck and aching body. I knocked on Hotspot's door and he sprung out of bed with Harlowe's energy. I drank an espresso. I brushed my teeth. I got in the car. I beat what everyone said was the hardest part.

Elizabeth drove us the 20 minutes to the cadre house in Grandcamp-Maisy where we met in the backyard. It was a very odd place to start an event. I recognized about 20 faces from the Heavy. Fortunately an additional 20 - 30 folks filled the yard. ""Thank God,"" I thought to myself. ""They're going to have to carry most of the load tonight."" I’ve never “grey manned” an event, but to be completely honest, I was fine with all the new folks carrying the weight. I was dying as the cadre ordered us into our ranks and began the admin process.

The admin was the same as the Heavy, but without the time requirement to rebuild rucks and all the running. To get us pumped, the cadres showed us the opening scene of “Saving Private Ryan,” in which the first wave stormed Omaha Beach. I had watched it about 100 times before showing up in France and then watched the whole movie again with Hotspot the night before the Heavy.

Mocha Mike took charge and made us run a couple blocks to a soccer field. We then ran a few laps around the perimeter of the field. Enter Jennifer. She was struggling at the back of the pack and when I decided to fall back and help out, I found her crying. I ran with her for a good while, falling far back from the pack and catching some shit from the cadre, but I wasn't going to leave a man behind. I did everything I could to convince her to stay in, but she looked at me and said, ""I can't. I'm out."" I felt like I had been kicked in the nuts. Jennifer walked over to the cadre as I ran and caught up with the team. I'm not sure what the cadre said, but Jennifer rejoined the crew and I'm happy to write that she finished the event.

We spent the next hour or so learning military movements - how to move as a fire team, a squad, a unit, etc. Lots of bounding and low crawls. I had already received this lesson and I wasn't appointed a team leader, so this was a good chance for me to flake out mentally. There were moments when we laid on the ground for a couple minutes at a time while another team was being taught or chewed out. This was a nice time to close my eyes. Cadre Heath yelled to me ""why aren't you moving?"" Because I'm sleeping, dude.

We grabbed our coupons and began the march toward Pointe du Hoc, first stopping at the bottom of a different cliff to give us some perspective as to what the Rangers saw on D-Day. History lesson time... Pointe du Hoc is a tall cliff, the highest point between Utah and Omaha beaches. This cliff gave the Nazis a strong tactical advantage because they could see both beaches as well as far out into the ocean. Huge guns were atop the cliff that could reach both beaches and inflict huge casualties. For the Normandy invasion to be successful, the allied forces had to first capture Pointe du Hoc, so 225+ Rangers scaled the cliff walls while the enemy shot down on them. Basically, our guys were sitting ducks. We took the cliff, but out of 225 Rangers, only 95 survived.

We climbed to the bottom of the cliff and looked up in awe. How did anyone at all survive? We spent a good bit of time listening to history lessons and Cadre Heath's tutorial on how to climb the cliff with limited equipment. He then gave us the opportunity to scale part of the cliff. You could easily tell who completed the Heavy a few hours before because most of us were cuddled up together on rocks, trying to stay warm, and listening rather than participating. I even saw a couple folks asleep. I wanted to climb the cliff but I honestly felt unsafe due to my drowsiness and deliriousness. At this point I wasn't all there. I laid back on a few huge rocks and ate an almond butter and jelly wrap given to me by a teammate while enjoying some needed time off my throbbing feet.

We climbed back up the cliff and began our trek toward Pointe du Hoc where we arrived shortly before sunrise. I could see the sky turning to a light blue which meant it was somewhere close to 5 am when we arrived at the infamous battle field, covered in huge craters where massive bombs hit the ground but did not destroy the Nazi bunkers of concrete with reinforced steel rods. We did not stay long because we couldn't see much in the dark. We proceeded to the Pointe du Hoc museum where we PT’ed, filled up with water and met Cadre Dan and Cadre Mickey who took over from Heath and Mocha Mike. This was an indication that we were halfway through our challenge.

The sun rose and we went back out the to the Pointe were we able to see the full view of the landscape with a long view of the ocean out front, Utah Beach to our left and Omaha Beach to our right. It was obvious why this point was so vital. We paused for a team pic at the Ranger monument before beginning our long walk to Omaha Beach where I entered the darkest moments of the entire HTL, the darkest moments of any fitness event I have tried to conquer.

In January I felt like quitting while enduring the Greenville GORUCK Tough Challenge with a high temperature, stopping on the side of the road often to hack up green nastiness. A couple months later I ran the Palmetto 200 on a six-man ultra team, rushing to every transfer point to spend all downtime in a port-a-potty. Neither compared to the long walk to Omaha Beach atop the high cliffs overlooking the English Channel.

We walked for miles, for hours. Every step was a shock through my feet. We walked single file, creating an accordion effect. Stop, walk, stop, walk, stop, walk for hours and hours. We stopped and I would drop to my hands and knees for 15 seconds at a time. I had to get off my feet. I was dying. I tried using the mental techniques I practiced for months. I tried meditating and sleeping walking. I had to get my mind somewhere other than thinking of every step. It worked for a while but time beat me.

We visited Omaha Beach the day before and Hotspot cracked a joke about a trailer park atop the cliffs. So I knew that we would see white trailers indicating our arrival. We walked along beautiful wheat fields that looked exactly like the scene from Gladiator when Russell Crow was dying and walking toward his family. We took turns around rows of trees breaking up the fields, and at every turn I knew those trailers would be in sight. Turn after turn, they were not. Those fucking trailers. Where are they?

I fell back to the very end with a couple other hurting HTL folks and cadre Mickey. I chatted with a dude from the UK to pass the time. Then another funny Englishman fell back, cracking jokes that lightened the mood. That was until we heard two guys yelling at each other with other folks getting in between to break up a possible fight. Both Cadre Dan and Mickey saw the argument and Dan said, ""You will pay for that."" Those blue falcon sons of bitches. Finally. The trailers!

This was my eighth GORUCK event and I am proud to say that I've never “grey manned” even one event. I've carried my load. I'm always the first guy to grab heavy shit. Until now. I “grey manned” most of the night, allowing the fresh folks who didn't do the Heavy to carry the weight. I got on sandbags for short stretches but not long enough to be proud of myself. I was a lousy teammate. Knowing we were close to Omaha and despite a lot of PT coming our way, the long walk was nearly over, I grabbed a heavy sandbag and carried it home the last twenty or so minutes. Then we were staring out over Omaha Beach. Just one problem. There was no beach.

The cadres huddled up to talk about their audible. We knew what they wanted to do. They wanted us to storm the beach like we did in the Heavy. Their plan was to put us in the water and make us crawl our asses the 300 yards from the water to the cliffs. But they didn't expect it to be high tide where the water literally came all the way up to the road. Instead they decide to punish us for the earlier altercation between the blue Falcons.

They put us in the freezing water for a lot of PT. Push-ups, flutter kicks, squats and a lot more. Then we got into the shape of Higgins boats, walked out to chest deep water, then ran back to dry land, over a sharp embankment to the shore. Now comes my only complaint about the cadre. In the heavy we got in the freezing water and were PT’ed quickly and harshly to get our core temperatures back up. It sucked, but it also made the cold less dangerous. This time the cadres huddled us up for a long history lesson on Omaha Beach. We sat there for what seemed like an hour, freezing our asses off. The cadre allowed us to put on extra clothes, but most of us either didn't have any or what we did have was soaking wet. Hotspot and I just leaned on each other to share body heat as Cadre Dan drew put his sand map. Yeah, I know. I'm whining like a little bitch. Embrace the suck, right? I tried, but I didn't stop shaking until I was about half way home.

[caption id=""attachment_365"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""400""]<img class=""wp-image-365 size-full"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/poopy-face-2-photo-cred-vincent-lee.jpg"" alt=""poopy face 2 - photo cred vincent lee"" width=""400"" height=""265"" /> <em>Photo cred: Vincent Lee </em>[/caption]

Elizabeth and Harlowe showed up and watched as we shook. I told her ""I've never hurt this bad. You have to fix my feet or I'm done."" I had gone 40 hours but I was very close to not making it 10 more.

After the history lesson we formed back up to recite the Ranger creed with Mocha Mike. He messed up and made himself do 25 push-ups. I thought that was awesome. Then we all did push-ups. Then we were patched.

[caption id=""attachment_366"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""400""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-366"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/patched.jpg"" alt=""Photo cred: Vincent Lee "" width=""400"" height=""533"" /> <em>Photo cred: Vincent Lee</em>[/caption]

Hotspot and I were in bad shape. The worst shape I had ever been in. I stripped down to my undies, got in the car and turned on the heat as high as it would go. Again, Elizabeth had food waiting for us. ""I'm sorry, but we need to go home again,"" I told her. She got us home fast. We showered and got in our beds. Elizabeth nursed my feet and I said, ""I may be finished."" She replied ""the hell you are. Go to sleep. You have 45 minutes."" Damn, I love this woman.

Everyone said the hardest part was showing back up for the Tough. I wasn’t so sure. Showing back up for the Light may be the biggest accomplishment yet. If I make it.

379,"Being A Rucker And A Runner Is Pretty Damn Hard","<h2>Starting over really sucks</h2>
In just six months I accomplished three tasks I thought far beyond my reach. I ran a marathon. I ran on a 200 mile six man ultra marathon team. I finished a GORUCK HTL in Normandy. But today I continued my transition from rucking back to running and struggled every second of my short three mile run. I felt like it was my first run ever. I couldn't breathe. My legs burned. My back hurt. I was a pitiful little bitch.

Rucking and running are two completely different beasts. Not a whole lot of people do both. In fact, I know a ton of folks who have gotten into rucking just because they either hate or ""can't"" run. Rucking requires you to be a pack mule. You need to bulk up and be able to carry a heavy ruck and a bunch of heavy coupons for a long time. Running requires you to be fast and lean. You need to slim down and get your endurance up.

Carry heavy shit, run fast, bulk up, slim down. It's a physical yoyo. There's no easy way. You just do it.

So that's what I'm doing now. I'm still lifting three days and rucking bootcamps three days, but all my miles have gone from rucking to running

Twelve days wasn't enough recovery time after the HTL. I lifted and ran last week and then led a GORUCK tough simulation for six hours on Friday night. I didn't participate. I barked orders. But just walking ten miles showed that my back, feet and legs are still in recovery. Today's run proved they still need time.

390,"When Your Day Goes To Shit 15 Minutes After Waking Up","<h2>Mama said there'll be days like this</h2>
I woke up in the best mood. Yesterday was one of the best days we've had at Push in awhile after Marco announced for US Senate. Last night I got the Landrover driving again for the first time in four months. I've been crushing my workouts and food/alcohol intake all week. It's been a great week.

This morning I planned to double down on my workouts so I started toward the door at 4:50 am for F3 Summerville's Magma, our ruck bootcamp, followed by Tremor, our running group. I bent down to pick up my ruck with my right arm and OH SHIT! A sharp pain ran throughout my upper back followed by an intense contraction of muscles. I hit the floor. I got stuck in the bed for two hours.

It's now 12 hours later and I can barely move. My chiropractor loosened me up for a few hours but now I'm as stiff as a board again. I screwed myself up good. It turns out that as I wrote yesterday, my body hasn't recovered from the HTL yet. I'm going to take a few days off from any physical activity and, because I'm getting LASIK surgery on Monday, this means I'm out of commission for at least a week. I'm not a happy man today.

It's now 10:30 pm, five hours since I wrote that last paragraph. I'm broken down in a Walgreens parking lot. I guess the Landrover is in as bad shape as I am. I'll leave it here and deal with this shit tomorrow. I'm Ubering home, posting this blog and hitting the sack in hopes that tomorrow is better.

Mama said there'll be days like this.

Now is your chance because over the next few weeks we will be rolling out a series of these videos so that you can see what our agency looks like from the inside out, from the view of different team members. 

The first one is from my view on the day I got back from a two week vacation. So yeah, it was pretty slammed packed with meetings.  I typically start working at 7 am and go late into the evening, but here you can get a glimpse into the 9-5 hours. Believe it or not, my videographer doesn’t go home with me. =)

401,"It's Been One Of Those Weeks","I've recommitted to blogging but it was just one of those weeks where I could barely keep my head above water. I got LASIK surgery on Monday and now I can see unaided for the first time since I was a teenager. I woke up Tuesday with nearly perfect vision. It's like magic.

Elizabeth had not spent one day or night alone since Harlowe was born over two years ago so I put her up in a swanky Charleston hotel, she booked two days at a spa and I took Harlowe. Time alone with Harlowe is a lot of fun, but the kid is like a a category five hurricane, destroying everything in his path. If I turn away for two seconds he's doing something like the picture above.

With my ""free time"" I helped raise a ton of cash for Marco and our other candidates for the end of the quarter deadline. We had major projects for our largest corporate client. And it was GOP primary week for our New York candidates. So yeah... little time for Push or personal blogging.

You aren't supposed to workout for four days after LASIK surgery, but I was able to get in two good ones this week. I also blew my food and alcohol diets this week. Hard training begins on July 5th.

412,"I’m Experimenting With A Ketogenic Diet","I’ve had a hell of a time figuring out my diet this year. The more I work out, the more it seems that I can’t adequately fuel my body. I’m always tired. There have been days where I’ve literally fallen asleep at my desk.

During running season, I love going vegan. But that’s incredibly hard while traveling because I basically have to eat all day long. I got lean and fast, but I found myself crashing on long runs and dozing off on conference calls.

I went back to meat in a big way in an attempt to bulk up for the GORUCK Normandy HLT while lifting, but I’m not on any kind of a diet, which means I cheat a lot and eat a bunch of shit food I shouldn’t be eating. I need something to follow; something to keep me on course.

I’ve read a lot about ketogenic diets, first introduced on <a href=""http://fatburningman.com/tim-ferriss-what-ketosis-does-to-your-brain-why-hes-not-doing-crossfit-and-how-to-evaluate-your-husband/"">Tim Ferris’ podcast.</a> Then a couple weeks ago my chiropractor, who also specializes in nutrition, recommended that I try it. So, tomorrow, I begin an experiment to see how a ketogenic diet will work for me.

Ok, so what is a ketogenic diet? I’m super pumped you asked.

The ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet. Instead of using carbs as energy, your body turns to fat, which is a lot easier for the body to break down, which saves energy.  The body also turns fat into ketones, which can increase brain activity and clear up that foggy feeling you may sometime feel or, for me, what I’ve been feeling a lot the more I work out. People on a ketogenic diet say they feel as if “the lights are turned out.” I could write about this forever, but <a href=""http://www.ruled.me/3-reasons-keto-better-for-brain/"">click here for a good summary</a>. In short, more physical energy and more mental energy.

What I can eat: lots of meat, fatty fish, eggs, butter, cream, unprocessed cheese, nuts, seeds, healthy oils, low-carb veggies and a whole lot of avocados.

What I can’t eat: sugary foods, grains or starches, fruit, beans, root veggies, low-fat foods, unhealthy fats or alcohol.

WHAT!?!?! No alcohol? With the brewery moving in, this will obviously be the hardest item. I plan to go back to my one-day-a- week cheat rule. I’ll blow the diet out of the water and drink my ass off one day a week—typically Saturday.

As for working out, it was July 4th weekend so you know it was pretty bad. I didn’t work out on Sunday or Monday and ate like shit. I drank a ton on Sunday. This morning I Q’d the F3 Summerville ruck and run groups back-to-back. I dragged ass bad during the ruck bootcamp. I put the boys on duck walks, lunge walks and a TON of fireman carries. I intended on running five miles, but only got in 1.5 before quitting. The humidity crushed me and I was feeling pretty nasty after the bootcamp. My back was also killing me after carrying around my ruck, Stringbean and his ruck. I’m guessing that’s somewhere around 280 pounds.

Along with the new diet, this week is my comeback week. I rested from the HTL, injured my back and got LASIK surgery. There are no excuses now. Training for the next few events has begun. Let’s roll.

415,"Will You Join Me And Do Something Badass in 2016?","<h2><em>Sometimes cliches are true</em></h2>
Happy Wednesday. I'm off to Orlando for a meeting with one of our corporate clients. I posted this to my Facebook page a couple weeks ago but those things get lost so today I'll post here with an open invitation for you to join me.

2016 has been a huge year and I've knocked out some big goals, including some physical feats I never thought I could do. I always told myself ""I can't do that."" I hear that shit all the time from people. I also hear ""you can do anything you put your mind to"" which is so cliche that it is almost always ignored.

Here's the deal people: it's true. It's not some mumbo jumbo bullshit. I'm not a runner. There's no way I can run a marathon or run 200 miles on a six-man ultra marathon team. I'm weak, have never been athletic and I don't even like getting dirty. I can't complete a GORUCK event, much less a Heavy or an HTL.

Y'all, let's be honest here. Anyone who knew me growing up will tell you I'm a wuss. I'm the guy who dressed up for Star Trek conventions. I didn't play sports. I went 36 years without lifting weights.

But somehow I did all that and more in the last seven months. It's because I decided I was going to do it, I set goals, I made plans and I stuck to them.

The year isn't over yet and there's a lot more to do. So, again, I'm inviting you to join me. Hit me up and let's start training.

July 15 - Charleston GORUCK Tough

July 16 - Charleston GORUCK Light

October 13 - GORUCK Firearms Night Training

November 5 - Savannah Marathon

November 12 - Sweet Tea Half Marathon

December 10 - Kiawah Marathon

Haven’t signed up yet. Will be determined by baby’s birth:

September 9 - Task Force Dagger Custom GORUCK Tough - Charleston

September 30 - Mogadishu Mile GORUCK Tough - Charlotte

420,"How The Internet Is Fueling Hate","Last week was rough, and I went to bed last night praying that we would start fresh today with less hate and more hope. Yet this morning I woke up to stories of more protests, some of which closed down interstates here in South Carolina, fueling more hateful rhetoric online. We are a digital firm and, as such, we have been loud proponents of transparency through online tools for more than a decade. Unfortunately, today I see almost too much transparency; revealing the evil parts of society and the dark parts of man.

Perhaps as a byproduct of the reality television generation or just the egotistical nature of man, today many want to go beyond just speaking their minds or sharing their moments with their friends. They literally want to broadcast their entire lives online. We used to make fun of those who shared everything they eat or every time they went to the bathroom, but today that’s become the norm. It’s even encouraged by the world’s largest digital companies like Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter. You don’t have to watch a wave of Pokemon GO addicts — heads down and walking into walls — to know that we are all living in our cell phones. We aren’t just using our cell phones. They don’t just have our attention. We are living in them. They are our homes. Which means that, inevitably, those things that should stay in our homes become public.

I don’t know if there are more cop shootings today than there were a decade ago. I don’t know if there is more violence in general than there was a decade ago. What I do know is that now we see it because of the way we are living our lives. We don’t have to watch occurrences filtered through the media because now everyone is the media. Everyone is a reporter armed with a camera able to broadcast to the world immediately. And because of that we can see a black man soaked in blood, dying in the driver's seat of a car — while a four-year-old comforts her mother as it is happening. I don’t know what it’s like to be black in America. But at least I now have more empathy because I see it happening in realtime without life being recreated through a revisionist historian. There are no doubts, no questions. There it is, right there. That’s the good part of digital transparency.

Here’s the bad part: The responses are immediate. People aren’t just telling their neighbors their thoughts. They tell everyone. And those thoughts are magnified and built upon with more thoughts. Then arguments happen because, online, you don’t have to look a person in the eye to call him or her a name. Everything gets heated. The differing sides split further, each collecting more members growing further and further apart. The angry and inflammatory rhetoric spills over into the real world where more protests and more violence happens—and all of it broadcast online where the cycle continues. Eventually, you can’t be for black people AND the police. You can’t be for gay people AND gun rights. You’re for one or the other.

Today, we have all knowledge from the entire history of the world at our fingertips. We are able to collaborate with people from the other side of the world. It’s free. It’s immediate. It’s small enough to fit in our pockets. We have the tools at the right price and at the right speed to solve all the world’s problems. All it takes is effort. But those efforts are being wasted on the self-indulgence of the “look at me, look at me” generation and the idea that free speech really means “I should tell everyone exactly how I feel all the time, and I should be perpetually validated.”

We hoped the Internet would be a place where people would come together, share big ideas and solve big problems. I still have that hope. But today, as I type this, the Internet is a place for people to reveal the darkest parts of their souls, dividing our nation — because yelling obscenities is easier than watching a TED Talk.","We don’t have to watch occurrences filtered through the media because now everyone is the media.

424,"The Gate Dropped And We Stormed Omaha Beach","<h2><em>GORUCK Normandy HTL, The Light</em></h2>
We were giddy as we arrived back at Omaha Beach for the last five hours of our journey. The Light is supposed to have a 100% pass rate. It's not easy, but we knew we were in the clear now. Our attitudes improved even more when we arrived and saw more new faces (a/k/a fresh shoulders to carry heavy shit). Now it's time to have some fun. Every single ounce of everything in us can be left on the beach.

The admin went the same as the last two events, except this one included a lot more smiles. Jen's ruck was full of shitty French beer which I hoped we would get into soon. The sky cleared, the sun peeked out and the temperature rose higher than it had been all week. The waves rolled back to reveal a huge beach; what the men of D-Day saw when they arrived at low tide. The pain of the last 45 hours just faded away.

A ceremony began at the monument. We were told to kneel and watch as an older man was presented an award of some sort while a wreath was laid on the monument. We all clapped as he received his award and we learned that he was an eight-year- old boy the day the Allied forces arrived to liberate his family and his homeland. To honor his liberators, he opened a museum which he ran for 60 years. This was his retirement ceremony.

<img class=""size-full wp-image-428 alignleft"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0022.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0022"" width=""500"" height=""281"" />

The team leader and assistant team leader were appointed—a young new couple, both of whom looked pretty fit and capable of completing a full HTL. Not sure why they just showed up for the Light. Maybe they were just smart. We snatched up all the heavy shit and began our few miles march along the beach to the American cemetery. The walk hurt bad. My feet and shoulders were cooked. But the end was in sight and I couldn't stop smiling and talking shit to my teammates.

After a tough climb up a steep hill we arrived at the American cemetery where we were given a thirty-minute break to visit the cemetery. All the pain of the last forty-six hours built up to this point, and as we looked out across the white crosses, we couldn't help but tear up. Hotspot and I started looking for fallen soldiers from South Carolina. After finding a couple we stopped to pray, thanking God for the freedoms he has bestowed upon us through the lives of men like these. That's when those huge planes from day one started low flyovers across the cemetery, over and over and over. The small drops in my eyes became real tears falling down my face, something I couldn't help from happening.

<img class=""wp-image-429 alignright"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13343071_10104068174367877_7673615250460023104_n.jpg"" alt=""13343071_10104068174367877_7673615250460023104_n"" width=""311"" height=""415"" />

The minutes of our break ticked down and we regrouped where we dropped all our coupons. We began the walk back to the beach, stopping half way to take in the view. The ocean was at low tide revealing a beach two football fields long; something we didn't see during the Tough. This is where the Germans would have looked out at our boys storming the beach, easy targets for them to gun down. From this view we wondered how anyone survived, as we watched tourists walk along the beach and the planes continued flying overhead.

For the first time during the event we felt the sun hit our faces and the temperature seemed to have jumped twenty degrees. For the first time we looked forward to getting into our Higgins boats. And luckily for us, that's exactly what the cadres had planned next. Here's where we had fun for the first time in 48 hours. I was made a Higgins boat leader and Hotspot was made our platoon leader. For the third time, we waded back into the water up to our waists, but this time we hit a sandbar, so we kept walking. We were much farther out than the first two times. The cadre started splashing water on us and we bobbed up and down. The pretend gate dropped and we darted for the shore; across the sandbar, back into waist-deep water and then finally the shore. Out of breath, we hit the sand where I led our group up the beach with bounds and low crawls as if bullets were flying above and shells exploding beside us. We moved seamlessly and I was giddy. Cadre Mickey said, ""Good job. That was fast. You can stop here."" For the first time during the event, I disobeyed; saying ""No sir, you said to get my men off the beach."" He laughed as I pushed my men to the dunes for cover. We laid down cover for our brothers and sisters still on the beach.

<img class=""size-full wp-image-430 aligncenter"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0024.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0024"" width=""500"" height=""500"" />

After the fun we paused for the normal sand map and explanation of D-Day by Cadre Dan. We asked the cadre if we could wash off and he said no, yet some dumbasses did so anyway. Fucking blue falcons. So the cadre punished us by making sugar cookies, which is exactly what it sounds like. Each of us had to roll around in the sand until every single inch of our bodies, including hair and faces, was covered in sand.

We began the walk back to our Endex point and my feet hurt like a son of a bitch. My shoes were full of dirt and mud was grinding into my blisters. We reached the end where our families waited. I had never been so happy to see Elizabeth and Harlowe. I cried, again.

The cadre weren't done with us yet and we were so happy that we didn't care at all. We were on cloud nine. They put us back in the water for more PT including push-ups, rucking chairs, squats with rucks overhead, flutter kicks and a few other things I don't remember. By the way, doing flutter kicks facing the ocean is really difficult when waves are crashing and water is going up your nose. Do flutters facing the beach.

The non-HTL folks were patched as we did more PT. Then it was our turn, only 16 left out of 36 who went in. Harlowe played on the beach while Elizabeth stood near the water, watching us, still in the water, hugging each other and the cadre. We were patched with our Light and our HTL patches as the rest of the crew cheered.

442,"Judging my GORUCK Normandy HTL Performance","<h2><em>GORUCK Normandy HTL, Part 5</em></h2>
It’s over a month later and I’m still in pretty bad shape. I’m typing this on an airplane with my back aching so bad that the pain has wrapped around my ribs to the front of my body, making it hurt to breathe at times. I know. I sound like a whiny little bitch, but I want to be honest so that you can learn from what I did right and what I did wrong.

I’ve put my body through more in the past year than I’ve put it through in my entire life. Lots of GORUCK events, a marathon, a few half marathons, an ultra-marathon relay, a 200-mile relay in the mountains. It’s been a real adventure and nothing meant as much to me as finishing the Normandy HTL. I will cherish this so much that I’ve even considered getting my first tattoo as the three HTL lightening bolts. I can’t recommend this event more.

With all this adventure, I have put my body through hell.  The biggest thing I’ve done wrong is jump from event to event without letting my body heal. For some reason I’m not learning from my own mistakes because I have another Tough/Light in two days and right now it hurts to breathe.  I have to slow down and let my body catch up.

Earlier this year I caught a lot of hell from my F3 “brothers” because a ton of them dropped from a custom HTL. Someone tweeted that the cadre was too hard and I argued that’s their job. They’re supposed to be hard and crying about it isn’t an option. It’s on us to train. So of course that means I have no empathy for my brothers and that resulted in a lot of mean comments to me like “you’re bad for the F3 and GORUCK community.” If I’m going to bust balls for not training, I sure as hell better train hard. So that’s what I did.

Jumping from running to rucking and back to running has been tough. You can read a lot more about that <a href=""http://wesleydonehue.com/starting-really-sucks/"">here</a>. I have a runner’s body, not a pack mule’s, so GORUCK events are always pretty tough for me and they take a bigger toll on my body than I’ve seen for my brothers. Slimming down for a marathon and then bulking up for the HTL was real tough. But I definitely believe that going from a mostly vegan diet to eating a lot of meat and adding three weight lifting days a week helped me tremendously during the HTL.

Going in, my weekly schedule looked something like this for four months:

Lift x 3
Bootcamp w/ ruck x 3
Ruck 20 miles

Lifting and bootcamps were the right call. Stopping running for four months was the wrong call because I lost a lot of my endurance, even with the bootcamps. If I had to do it over again, I would add in at least two, maybe three, good runs each week. I didn’t ruck nearly enough miles, evident by the fact that my biggest problems were with my feet and legs. I should have gotten closer to 35 or 40 each week. But shit, who has that much time? I should have sacrificed some of that bootcamp time for long rucks.

I did a lot of mental training. I meditated, did the Wim Hoff (breathing) method, did pain- coping training, watched a lot of WW2 movies and TV shows and read a few books about Normandy. They say that these events are more mental than physical and, mentally, I was friggin’ ready. I think this is the primary aspect people neglect. Scratch that. I don’t think it. I know it. So I’ll write a lot more about this in the future.

Having Hotspot by my side made all the difference. Having a buddy to train with, to travel with and to endure pain with got me through it and, honestly, I don’t know if I would have shown back up to the Tough without Hotspot. He pushed me and I pushed him. I was determined not to let my brother down in any way. He was going to finish this thing come hell or high water and he treated me the same exact way. It’s amazing what you can do with a brother or sister by your side. Have one.

Having brothers back home cheering me on gave me so much joy and strength. I saw Elizabeth after finishing the Heavy and one of the first things she said was “everyone is texting and Facebooking me.” She showed me so many messages that put fuel in my empty tank. Build your cheering section.

As for packing, I packed a bit too much food but it didn’t make a ton of difference. A full bottle of ibuprofen and a full bottle of Tylenol were everything I needed. <a href=""http://www.goodrx.com/blog/is-it-safe-to-take-tylenol-acetaminophen-with-advil-or-motrin-ibuprofen/"">Read more about that here</a>. I should have broken in my new <a href=""http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/sfb-field-6-mens-boot/pid-10028423/pgid-10349227"">Nike boots more</a>. Allin all, my packing and clothing choices were pretty spot on.

Now that a month has passed, I feel I can judge myself objectively (no one is a harsher judge of me than me). I believe I did very well. I was a good teammate. I carried my load and was always one of the first people to jump up when someone cried out for help. I absolutely crushed the Heavy. I did let myself down during the Tough. I “grey-manned” a lot of it while hurting bad. I tried not to bitch too much but the pain showed on my face. I barely made it through. However, I redeemed myself during the Light and went at it with every ounce of energy left in my body. The setbacks during the Tough stop me from getting an A or even a B+, but I give myself a solid B for performance.

I don’t think any HTL is easy and this was certainly the hardest thing I’ve ever done. However, I do believe the historical aspect gave us a lot more to think about rather than just the pain. And because these things are as much mental as physical, that made the event easier than what I imagine a lot of HTLs are.

Lastly, let me brag on my wife. She was our savior. She got us from point A to point B, got us fed, washed our clothes, yelled at us and made us get out of bed, took care of my feet and much more, all while dragging along a two-year-old in France with no clue where she was. My wife is such a badass. Be sure to find yourself an Elizabeth for your HTL.

460,"The Best Facebook Presence Of Any Craft Brewery In The Entire Nation","When we became partners in Frothy Beard Brewing Company, we set a goal of having the best social media presence of any craft brewery in the entire nation. We knew that would be a lofty goal given the establishment of the big dogs like Sierra Nevada, Sam Adams, Oskar Blues and New Belgium, and all their money. But we are an award-winning digital company that just ran a presidential campaign and is still running some of the biggest campaigns in the nation. So we can do this. Of course we can. It’s just going to take some time.

Well, it isn’t taking as much time as we thought. Today we were named by <a href=""https://www.craftbeer.com/craft-beer-muses/9-breweries-on-facebook-you-should-follow"">craftbeer.com</a> as having the best Facebook presence in the nation, beating out not just the big dogs, but every other craft brewery in the nation. They wrote:

<blockquote>Here’s a nanobrewery who’s nailing digital all-around from their amazing illustrations, to tone across all touchpoints, to authenticity. Although they have not yet reached 10,000 fans, they’ve laid the digital groundwork to grow as big as they can dream. Being a coastal brewery with plenty of ties to the sea (check out the adorable octopus on their growler!), the guys jumped on their love for Shark Week while also displaying their goofy personalities that certainly make fans want to have a pint with them or while watching the week-long event.</blockquote>

I guess that’s what happens when a brewery has full-time advertising and social media experts, designers, videographers, web developers and much more partnering with them. If you think our social media is awesome now, just wait until the construction ends and the brewery opens. Push and Frothy will literally be in the same building. Big things, people. Big things!

Thanks for all the support.

464,"Here’s The Real Problem With Snapchat","YAY! Another blog about Snapchat because I was quoted in a story and, yet again, my full thoughts didn’t come across well in two sentences and I started getting all kinds of calls and emails. <a href=""https://www.politicopro.com/campaigns/story/2016/07/why-senate-republicans-are-going-all-in-on-snapchat-123864"">You can read the article here.</a>

This morning I was asked “if you hate Snapchat so much, why do you snap 60 times a day?” It’s for the same reason that I bought an Apple Watch and have been playing Pokemon Go. Wearables and augmented reality are the future. So is Snapchat. Also, I freakin’ love Snapchat. So there’s that.

NRSC executive director Ward Baker said in that Politico article “I think Snapchat is the future of voter contact.” I completely agree. That begs the question – why isn’t Snapchat now? Baker answered that question when he said “campaigns are historically awful at including new technologies in their strategies.”

Snapchat has the reach and the tools to be effective right now in political campaigns. Sure, I had some complaints about the company in that article, but they weren’t major. I said they are heading in the right direction. Fixing my issues is a matter of helping me make the platform salable to my campaigns. But right now campaigns, as much as folks like Baker are working their asses off to fix it, are still stuck in the past.

Here’s the deal. I rarely get a penny budgeted to me unless it can make two pennies. The digital teams have become nothing more than glorified fundraisers. We spend all day building email lists and then blasting those lists as much as possible for money. Occasionally we get money for a fun grassroots project or a gimmick to spank our opponents. Those aren’t places where Snapchat is useful, which is why I said they need a click-through feature.

In the beginning, the TV guys fought us tooth-and-nail saying that all persuasion dollars should be put on TV. Then we proved them wrong and we started getting some very small budgets. As digital blew up even more, the TV guys started accepting our premise and then they did the unthinkable, or actually what was totally predictable – they stole most of the persuasion dollars, arguing that they make the creative, so they should make the buys. Basically they just throw the TV ads on pre-roll and Facebook. (We can argue about that whole square peg/round hole issue in a different blog post). Because their TV ads won’t fit on Snapchat, they aren’t really buying on Snapchat –which is what all of us digital guys would like to see, but can’t control.

Now we get to the part where people will ask – does Snapchat really matter? Does it move numbers? My only answer is that I don’t friggin’ know. Campaigns won’t allocate the money to allow us to test it out. I strongly believe with all my heart that I can move numbers for younger demographics with Snapchat ads if I’m allowed to control the creative and given the appropriate ad dollars.

Sure, Snapchat has a few things to change (that would help me sell it to campaigns) in the functions the digital team can still control. But their downfall in the political realm isn’t on them. It’s on the campaigns, most of which are still stuck in the past. In a perfect world, all GOP campaigns would use Snapchat or, at a minimum, test it. In reality, that’s not going to happen under the current structures and with the current mindset. Speaking for myself, I just am not given adequate budgets, so I must spend resources in the places where I’ll be judged. Right now that’s mostly fundraising.

Luckily we have leaders like Ward Baker who are forcing campaigns into the future by making them spend more on digital and testing new platforms like Snapchat. What the NRSC is doing is totally correct. Campaigns should follow suit. I think they will, which is why I said Snapchat is the future. But I would much rather Snapchat be now.","YAY!

472,"Things That Drive Me Batshit Crazy","Common courtesy is no longer common—at least not in business, and not with email.

I don’t get it.

I’m busy, too. But you don’t have 20 seconds to type “No thank you” or “Can’t meet today” and press “send”? Really?

Only an asshole doesn’t respond to emails. It’s not just rude or disrespectful—it’s lazy.

It would be different if I were sending out “I just made 900 dollars an hour at home with Google” or whatever the latest spam scam is that hits your inbox.

But I’m writing to people about business—people I’ve met with—people who have initiated a conversation or meeting with me—who then don’t respond to follow-up emails.

Worse, I’m sending emails to people with whom I am currently doing business—and I get no reply. That’s “Does 10:30 tomorrow work?” and no reply. Seriously.

And, yes, the final category is people my company actually pays…who don’t respond. They seem to accept the money without any problem. It’s hitting “reply” that seems to be an excessive burden.

Email silence is passive aggressive and cowardly. It’s as though no response is “the new no.” It’s “sofa king” aggravating.

And, in some ways, slow response time is worse than no response at all. Responding days, weeks or even months later says “you’re not important to me” loud and clear. Response time is a non-verbal cue that speaks volumes about you as a person.

Please, people. Please. Email is already faceless. We’re not on the phone, we’re not sitting across from each other. But must it be discourteous?

How about this—how about setting up some time each day to go through email? Use an email management system if you need to (there are several out there). Be honest if you’ve missed some messages because of workload. Include something in your signature about when you normally reply. Check your spam folder. Do something.

It’s OK to respond with “no.” It’s OK to respond with “I’m sorry.” What’s not OK is not responding. It’s simply unacceptable. You’re in the business world. Even if you’re young, you’re an adult. Act like one.

476,"Bullshit McBullshit","I have to admit, it is sometimes embarrassing to be in politics. When asked the typical “what do you do” question, I often answer “insurance sales.” No one wants to be sold insurance on a plane or at a bar. But they do love talking about crazy. Don’t get me wrong—I love politics. And I appreciate and respect the courage it takes for candidates to put themselves out in the public eye for a campaign. But get asked about a certain candidate or a certain issue often enough and it gets to you.

Similarly, it can be embarrassing to run a digital marketing firm when you read some of the out-and-out horse shit some of these firms shovel. It’s almost like someone decided you get extra points based on the number of times you say “paradigm shifting” or words you make up like “dimensionalize.”

What clients want to know—and what we tell clients—is what we’re going to do, why we’re doing it, how we’re doing it, how we’re testing it and what it will cost. They want to know our ideas. They want to know how we will help solve their problems, achieve their goals. Yes, we speak and write well. And, yes, we make good-looking proposals. But they don’t have any b.s. in them. Not now.

483,"Whatever Else It Is - GORUCK Is Not 'Playing Army'","A couple times over the past year I have been criticized by different people (one currently serving and the other a veteran) for participating in GORUCK events. Specifically, I was accused of “playing Army” and bring disrespectful to members of the armed forces.

I was stunned.

GORUCK exists to honor our military. The company was founded by a veteran with a background in special forces.  One of the stated goals of GORUCK is to “build a bridge between the military and civilian worlds.”

Kind of difficult to do that when people are telling me what I do is “offensive.” That doesn’t build bridges—it <b>burns</b> them.

Just to be clear—I did not serve in the military. And I can’t go back in time to serve during WWII or Vietnam, or even to when I got out of high school. I spent the time between high school and now NOT participating in fitness activities of any kind. GORUCK and the endurance events they operate have been a godsend to me in many ways, one of which is connecting with servicemen and women who have become great friends.

And I respect and appreciate those who serve now as well as our veterans. I commend them for their sacrifice, their courage and their selflessness.

During GORUCK events, we carry an extra ruck (backpack)—“the ruck of the fallen.” So we honor the military in a tangible way at each grueling event. And we are required to bring $20 with us for each event—for cabfare in case we have to drop out. Almost without exception, it is freely donated after each event to a military charity chosen by the cadre in charge.

I went to Normandy on the D-day anniversary to push myself to the limit. GORUCK has three event levels—Heavy, Tough and Light. What I did in France was all three back-to-back-to-back. Almost 50 straight hours with almost no sleep. I cried with emotion at places like the American cemetery. And I cried with pain from overdoing it.

But what I went through was nothing compared to what the soldiers who were there experienced. Nothing.

I finished the GORUCK “HTL” and did pose for a photo on the beach with my patch. But not out of disrespect. Quite the opposite.

I wasn’t sitting on my ass binge-watching “Band of Brothers.”  (I mean—OK, I did do that, but then I actually got off the couch and went out and busted my tail.)

I was pushing myself to (and beyond) my physical limits in honor of the men who served, in the place where they served and where so many fell, on the 72nd anniversary of the day they invaded Europe.

I did it to honor them.

We live in a world where everyone is offended about everything. I shouldn’t be surprised when these two men criticized my efforts, but for some reason I was, and I still am. But if GORUCK has taught me anything, it’s to not Fing quit. So I’ll continue on while they criticize. After all, they’ll find something else to be offended about within the next few hours anyway.","GoRuck exists to honor our military.

494,"How To Push A One-Wheeled Trailer","<strong>Charleston GORUCK Tough Class 2000 AAR</strong>

I'm feeling my age this morning. Becoming athletic in my mid-thirties is taking a toll on my body. Yesterday we finished my tenth GORUCK event, a 14 hour Tough challenge in Charleston. It wasn't the hardest one I've ever completed or even one of the hardest, but I entered the event barely able to walk due to back pain. I woke up with the pain starting under my shoulder blade and wrapping around my ribs to the front of my body. Deep inhales, sneezing or coughing shot so much pain through my core that I nearly hit the floor. An adjustment by Adjustment (his F3 name because he's a chiropractor) loosened me up earlier in the day, but I started hurting again before the event.

A hard rain hit Charleston a couple of hours before the event and it cooled the temperature down to a bearable degree. We arrived 40 minutes early and began following the posted instructions by the cadre to be in equal ranks by alphabetical order. I haven’t been so surrounded by buddies since my first event. 28 F3 Summerville brothers and five FIA Summerville sisters composed nearly half the field of 70. Also on the team were F3's Cousteau (one of my best friends since college and Push partner), F3's Milton, F3's FEMA and F3's Metro, all brothers from other regions. I was also stoked to see Luc Gilgore and Allen Yeh, local ruckers and Facebook buddies. Personally knowing half the field really got me fired up.

This year, I had a goal to build up a strong F3 Summerville rucking group and made it my personal goal to get them ready for this event. Over the course of the last year and on separate occasions, some non-F3 ruckers have told me that F3 has put a bad taste in their mouth because so many show up unprepared, grey-manning portions of the event. That means they try to fade into the crowd instead of working. I'm not going to let my crew get that reputation, so I worked my butt off through daily workouts, simulations, happy hour lessons, blog posts, videos and individual chats to get our boys ready. I don't deserve credit for even 1% of the success we saw, but I'll take pride in knowing the preparation worked. I'll also take credit for a half of a percent :)

<img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-499"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/coupons.jpg"" alt=""coupons"" width=""960"" height=""641"" />

The event began with admin and introductions by the cadre. We were told to get wet by jumping into the fountain and get back to our spots in 30 seconds. Then we were in for some ""on your face"" and ""on your feet"" by the cadre and some overhead ruck holds. Then back into the fountain. It wasn't much of a welcome party, but they made up for it later with plenty of miles and heavy shit.

The Team Leader, Assistant Team Leader and Navigator were picked and I was appointed Navigator because I know my way around. However, the Team Leader knew a quicker way to Hampton Park, so I became an ATL to help him since he had never done an event before. This was great for me because I got an hour of walking, which really loosened up my back without having to carry heavy shit. We had a lot of people and a lot of coupons, so I appointed a coupon leader. I should have appointed Hotspot but I didn't see him and we had to move fast, so I appointed another experienced rucker.

The first movement is always rough because we're trying to figure out what we're working with. Which coupons (the heavy things) suck the most. Who are our beasts. Who are our weak links. How do we move that many people and follow traffic rules. What do these particular cadre care about.

<img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-500"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/first-movement.jpg"" alt=""first movement"" width=""960"" height=""641"" />

We arrived at Hampton Park pretty quickly but were told we didn’t make our time hack - which was bullshit - but he had to have a reason to PT us. After getting into formation pretty sloppily, we were told to sprint to the pond and back. Still sloppy as hell, we were told to run around the pond, which I did while wearing my ruck and the Ruck of the Fallen, a ruck we carry in honor of those servicemen and women who died for our nation. Because we left some men behind, we had to run three more times around the pond. I ran one lap with the Ruck of the Fallen and then another lap with Adjustment’s ruck.

It’s about here when Adjustment started hurting pretty bad. His calves locked up and he said he was out. The F3 Summerville boys rallied around him and convinced him to continue, but Adjustment was heading toward a real rough night. It never got much better for him.

Next up we had to do 2,000 burpees total, which divided by 70 was 29 each. Led by Coach, we knocked those out pretty easily and then we were forced to do some more running, this time suicides. We took a little breather, filled up on water and headed out toward the Citadel where we would sneak onto campus through a back gate lining the Charleston marsh. And by through, I mean over, to an awesome obstacle course.

<img class=""size-full wp-image-501 aligncenter"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/park.jpg"" alt=""park"" width=""960"" height=""641"" />

The obstacle course was one of the coolest things I’ve done in a GORUCK event and sneaking into the Citadel is definitely something I’ll be bragging about for a while. Next we got a long rest while everyone was finishing the obstacle course while awaiting the giant buoy’s arrival. What? A buoy? Yeah, this giant son of a bitch…

<img class=""size-full wp-image-502 aligncenter"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/bouy.jpg"" alt=""bouy"" width=""960"" height=""641"" />

Okay, this is the point where I should tell you that I stopped writing this post for two weeks and just got back on it today. I don’t remember exactly how everything went down now, but I’ll keep going. Back to that damn buoy.

We got on a twelve man rotation, six on and six off. I stayed on that rotation until we were able to finally drop the buoy. I kept my head down for the next few hours carrying that thing and somewhere along the way our mission changed and we went from securing the Charleston coast to finding a downed pilot, which was this heavy as hell medical tool. I don’t know what you call it. A mannequin?

We carried that thing and the buoy until our next resting spot where we were shown a trailer with one wheel. We dropped some of the weight and replaced it with the trailer. All the weight we still had, like the buoy and a bunch of other shit, went into the trailer. We stuck two big metal pipes through trailer to lift the wheel-less side off the group. Then a bunch of folks got on the metal pipes, some got in front of the trailer to pull, some got on the back to push and we were off moving again.

<img class=""size-full wp-image-503 aligncenter"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/trailer.jpg"" alt=""trailer"" width=""960"" height=""641"" />

I have no idea how many miles we carried that son of a bitch, but it was a long way and I just stayed on rotation with the poles sticking out the side. Three people were on each pole and the person closest to the trailer had most of the weight. This is where, as I write, I type in shame. To carry the pole we had to bend over at the waist. Remember, I went into the event with a bad back and didn’t think I should be there at all. Here I was moving a wheel-less trailer bent over at the waist. At one point my back caught and I literally said “I can’t do this.” FIA’s Renee Cleary, who was also on the pole, responded “Yes you can. Keep pushing.”

I felt like an ass. I’ve never said “I can’t” in an event. My back caught, a sharp pain shot through me and it just came out. That attitude absolutely cannot be tolerated and it won’t happen again. Man, what a little bitch comment.

Eventually we got rid of the trailer and began the VERY long walk back to ENDEX, through West Ashley and downtown Charleston, eventually reaching Waterfront Park. We had to do a little more PT, which included some welcomed flutter kicks in the fountain. After some encouraging words from our cadre, who were awesome by the way, we were patched.

<img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-504"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/coming-home.jpg"" alt=""coming home"" width=""960"" height=""641"" />

This was one of my favorite events to date. F3 Summerville turned out 28 guys. We trained together for months and then executed together. I can’t tell you how proud I am of my boys. Not one of them grey-manned the event. At one time I looked at that trailer and literally EVERY single person on it was F3 or FIA Summerville. I made it my personal goal to make sure these guys were mentally and physically prepared. Mark that down as an other accomplished goal because my brothers totally crushed this GRT.

This was class 2000, so we got special patches.

518,"Thirteen Entrepreneurial Lessons I Learned the Hard Way","It’s not easy being an entrepreneur. But it is easier if you know some things to do and not do.

Here are a few lessons on growing a business:

<strong>—The customer is not always right</strong>. Usually—but not always. Bend over backwards to please every client or customer? Even when they’re wrong? That’s not good for anyone—especially you.

<strong>—People—even friends—will screw you over</strong>. It would be nice if this weren’t true. But it is true. And it’s one more reason to separate your business life from your personal life. Especially when money is involved.

<strong>—Time really is money.</strong> You can get more equipment, you can get more people, you can get more supplies—but you cannot get more time.

<strong>—Hire people who are smarter than you are</strong>. Some people are intimidated by that prospect. Not me. And as soon as I find someone smarter than I am, I’ll hire…I’m kidding. I hire the smartest people I can find. You should as well.

<strong>—Work/Life balance.</strong> Maybe it’s me, or maybe it’s entrepreneurs in general, but I can’t turn it off. And I have to be the same me wherever I am. But I do try to manage my schedule (instead of the other way around) to have maximum time at my home and with my family.

<strong>—Hands-off vs. hand’s—on.</strong> If you have just started a business and you’re not a major VC-funded place or silver spoon guy, of course you’ll be hand’s on. But when the business grows, you have to know when to back off—and that can be tricky.

<strong>—You can’t operate in neutral.</strong> You have to keep your foot on the gas no matter what.

<strong>—Work hard, relax hard.</strong> Running a business can be stressful. Wait—did I just say that. Can be? Always is. And it’s an office job. So I need (and my body needs) physical activity. Exercise bike? Not exactly.

<strong>—Sluggish body means sluggish mind.</strong> On a ^ related note, if you sit on your ass all the time, eat snack food and drink soda, your brain will turn into mush. And you’ll be tired all the time—even during the day. If your body slows down, your brain slows down also. Moral of the story?

<strong>—You should only do the tasks that only you can do.</strong> Sounds simple, But isn’t. Not because you can’t trust other people to perform tasks flawlessly (although, there is that to consider) or because you are a control freak (no comment), but the really hard part is stopping doing some of the parts of the business you really enjoy.

<strong>—It’s all about making decisions.</strong> You can’t lose sleep over them—and some people really do. If you’re the boss, you make decisions all day long. And you can’t go up on a mountain and ponder your answer for a few weeks. If you aren’t good at making quick, reasoned decisions, get good at it. And fast.

<strong>—Sugar works better than vinegar in almost all situations (almost).</strong> Did your mother tell you catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar? She was right. (But not always.)

<strong>—Always push harder.</strong> If that’s the question before you—should I push harder, or not push that hard—push harder. Having a baby, opening a door that’s stuck, getting the best out of someone…push harder.

I’ll be writing about these individual topics at length in the coming weeks. Be sure to read them all and let me know what y’all think.","It’s not easy being an entrepreneur.

522,"Thoughts On Instagram Jacking Snapchat","Instagram had to make a move. They went from being the destination of choice for millennials to playing second fiddle once Snapchat exploded.

Given that they’re owned by Facebook and Facebook has a tendency to just straight up steal good ideas and make them native in their platform, it’s no big surprise to me that Instagram put Snapchat’s Stories features in its platform.

And by “put Snapchat’s Stories features in its platform” I mean they all-out jacked Snapchat and embedded it into Instagram. That happened, leaving everyone wondering why they should be using both.

From my previous ramblings about Snapchat, which have been numerous and all over the map, I’ve been pretty consistent on one huge gripe—finding your friends and new people to follow is one huge pain in the ass on Snapchat. I think its discovery tools are pretty awful and, basically, Snapchat is forcing you to use other platforms, like Facebook or Twitter, to tell people about your Snapchat page.

Instagram, on the other hand, allows you to connect to your Facebook page, import your friends and then follow them on the photo app. They even go so far as to alert you when one of your Facebook friends has joined Instagram. Boom! Easy peasy. That has allowed me to find all my buddies and in turn grow my following.

With Instagram, most of us already have a good following. With Snapchat, we have to start from scratch and then use other platforms, like Instagram, to tell our friends to follow us.

That makes you wonder, if you’re one of those people who haven’t jumped on Snapchat yet, but have been on Instagram, why would you jump to Snapchat? I’m not saying that this is going to be a Snapchat killer by any stretch of the imagination. But I do think it has the possibility to slow its growth, particularly with the older folks who typically migrate by following the younger early adopters.

I got pumped about Instagram for a while. You can find some great photos of my son, Harlowe, and his hat obsession there. #harloweshat. But lately I’ve been ALL ABOUT Snapchat. I would be more about it if they would give us an easier way to find our friends and discover new folks to follow, just like Instagram does.","Instagram had to make a move.

532,"The Humidity Is Sucking The Life Out Of Me","<em><strong>When training in a swamp...</strong></em>

It’s time to give you an update on training, diet and all things health related. Let's jump right in.

Today I got cut open for the first time ever. I had a lipoma removed from my neck. If you’ve seen me over the past year you’ve probably noticed a thing popping out the back of my neck. It wasn’t an alien that kept getting bigger. It was a lipoma, a fatty benign tumor. I was told it would just keep growing, like the size of a baseball so, yeah, had to get that sucker removed.

The ketogenic diet didn’t pan out, but I’m going to test it out again soon. I just wasn’t willing to give up beer in the middle of the summer when all I can think about in the afternoon is a cold Charleston craft beer. I need those carbs when it’s 100 degrees outside. Give me a couple months and I’ll get back on the diet.

Right now I’m just trying to eat super clean throughout the week and then cheat my butt off on Saturdays with garbage. I’m eating clean proteins and carbs with no processed sugars, sodas, junk food or any other crap. Except beer. That’s the big weakness right now. I have to let up at least 4 nights a week. I’ll feel pretty good if I can go the majority of nights with no beer. That’s pretty hard when you actually own a brewery.

Training for running season in Charleston, South Carolina is a real bitch, but I’m back on it. Last week was my first real week back. I set a goal of 24 miles and I hit it. This week I’m going for 26, then next week 28, 30 the following and so on until I’m at 40 - 50 miles a week going into marathon season. My goal is two half marathons and two full marathons in 2016, with another marathon in early 2017.

The humidity is sucking the life out of me. This morning I ran four miles in 96% humidity and felt like I was running in a swamp. I was gasping for air and having to stop nearly every mile. Not good! I stopped running earlier this year after a full marathon and an ultra-marathon relay and now I’m struggling at four- and six-milers. I keep telling myself it’s because of the humidity. Maybe I’m wrong, but it’s certainly not a muscular issue. My legs, feet and back are feeling pretty darn good. I just can’t breathe.

There’s only one thing to do - keep pushing. I’ll do that and give you another update soon.

Peace!

537,"The Customer Is Always Right","<em><strong>Entrepreneurial Tips #1</strong></em>

We’ve all heard that expression—“The Customer Is Always Right.” But is it true? Not always.

Don’t get me wrong—no one on planet Earth places a greater emphasis on client service than I do. But there are certain truths about business you just can’t ignore:

-Sometimes, the people who spend the least, create the most problems.

-Demanding clients waste time, eat up valuable resources, wear out and frustrate staff

-Tolerating a bad client can drive a wedge between you and your staff.

540,"People -Even Friends- Will Try To Screw You","<em><strong>Entrepreneurial Tips #2</strong></em>

You can sound kind of paranoid as an entrepreneur if you say, “Everyone is trying to screw me.” But I’m not saying that. No, everyone isn’t trying to—but a lot of people are. Or will be.

Here are some examples:

<strong>First,</strong> people will take things. Realize that some is of it is human nature. Acts of petty theft are common—you grab a few extra sweeteners at the coffee shop, get a soda refill you weren’t entitled to, etc. But common doesn’t mean acceptable, and everything costs something. Some are much bigger like actual money or ""business expenses"" that aren't at all really business related.

<strong>Second</strong>, people (including friends) believe that everything at your business and in your life is a “write-off” or can just be “charged to the business.” You wouldn’t have a business for long doing that.

<strong>The worst example</strong> of people trying to screw you is clients not paying. It wasn’t that long ago that I started my business—me, my laptop and one $250/month client. It was inconceivable to me that my clients wouldn’t pay their bills. And I would sweat bullets about making sure I could pay my rent, utilities and employees when I had some. I didn’t have a trust fund cushion or a gigantic bank line-of-credit—I had to have receivables in the form of retainers and charges for advertising buys and emails. I wear a lot of hats but never wanted to be a bill collector.

Here are some ways to <strong>avoid being screwed:</strong>

<strong>-don’t screw anyone yourself</strong> (there is something to be said for karma)

<strong>-only hire cool people</strong> (cuts way down on drama and many other unpleasant things)

<strong>-collect money on time</strong> (do what works in your industry, but try to get some upfront—bill 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, as an example. And don’t let overdue bills linger. A gentle reminder, then a call, then stop doing some client-related activities.)

<strong>-make sure employees know the relationship between costs and salaries</strong> (the higher the former, the less available for the latter—you’ll be surprised at the cost-saving ideas you’ll get)

<strong>-When all else fails, rely on “The X-Files”</strong> (Trust No One? I considered that! But, no—I Want To Believe. You have to, at a minimum, trust the people who help you with money—bookkeeper, CFO, CPA, banker, tax attorney, financial advisor. But I Want To Believe that I can trust most people close to me, because life is too short to think otherwise.)","Entrepreneurial Tips #2",2016-08-15,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/people-even-friends-will-try-screw/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MG_8120.jpg,"People -Even Friends- Will Try To Screw You",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MG_8120.jpg,,Blog,Entrepreneurial,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,people-even-friends-will-try-screw,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
544,"Own Up When You F Up","I don’t mind telling you that we screw up occasionally. Every company does. If you know a company that says they don’t, they are lying to your face. The real key is your reaction to your failure.

Yesterday, we F'd up big time for a client. Smart people learn from their mistakes so, through many, I knew exactly what to do.

<ol>
 	<li><b>Admit your mistake</b>. No one likes excuses or the blame game. There’s nothing worse than a person who shifts blame on others and just has excuse after excuse after excuse.  It can be difficult to accept responsibility for someone else's mistake, but your company  = your mistake. Your client = your mistake. Your project = your mistake. Moreover, some see admitting a mistake as a sign of <i>weakness</i>. I see it as a sign of <i>strength</i>.</li>
 	<li>Let them know <b>it won’t happen again</b>. What people tend to remember is how a problem was <i>handled</i>--rather than what the issue was in the first place. Show that you own the problem, and that you own the solution.</li>
 	<li>Make sure it never happens again by <b>enacting new procedures</b>. A couple years ago we totally F'd up for a congressional client. His campaign manager accepted it the first time. It happened again and she was still cool. By the third time she was pretty annoyed and I told his campaign manager that it wouldn’t happen again. Then, you guessed it, it happened again. We were fired and my response was, “We deserve it. I told you it wouldn’t happen again and it did. I’m very sorry.” I made a huge mistake by simply trusting the employee and not enacting new procedures. Remember that we employ humans--not robots--so mistakes are unavoidable. But a system of checks-and-balances--a proofreading process, everyone having a backup, a reminder like ""measure twice, cut once--can help reduce the likelihood of errors. Eliminate? No. But reduce? Yes.</li>
</ol>
<strong>CONCLUSION</strong>

Owning up to a mistake is something that was difficult for all of us to do even as children. Who wants to admit he broke the vase? But you really learn the lesson then--lying doesn't help, shifting blame doesn't help (if you have a sibling, there is always at least one more potential suspect), faking astonishment doesn't help. The only thing that helps is to say ""I made a mistake and I'm sorry."" FYI this works outside of business also.

Have you ever been inside a factory? Many have an updatable sign to track how successful they've been at <i>avoiding mistakes</i>. The sign reads something like ""We have gone ___  days in a row without a loss-of-work accident."" It's a constant reminder to everyone who works there to ""be on the lookout"" and a constant source of pride for everyone as the number grows thanks to a safer workplace.

At Push, this number is currently at one day. I'm looking forward to watching it grow.","I don’t mind telling you that we screw up occasionally. Every company does.

554,"According To A College No One's Ever Heard Of, Posting About Your Workout Is Bad","A survey from researchers at Brunel University London suggests that posting on Facebook about your workouts makes you a narcissist.

I read another survey recently and you know what it said? It said, “Kiss my boney white ass.”

Actually, that should have read “toned” because I work out a lot. If you don’t believe me, check my Facebook posts.

Here’s the deal: I don't post my workouts for me. I post them for my brothers. They post their workouts for me.

If you don’t know about it, F3 is men’s voluntary workout group. The name stands for Fitness, Faith and Fellowship. I post about my workouts to inspire my F3 brothers (as they inspire me). We hold each other accountable. I post early in the morning (like 4am early) to remind them all they do have time to work out (#1 reason for skipping—“not enough time”). Get out of bed! Get moving!

Posting about the workouts helps make these men better, helps make me better, helps make our community better. We’ve had an unbelievable 400 men come through F3 in Summerville. I've recruited nearly 100 guys to take on insane fitness events like half marathons, marathons and GORUCK challenges. It’s an important part of my life. These men are important to me.

558,"Time Really IS Money","<em><strong>Entrepreneurial tips #3</strong></em>

We’ve all heard that phrase. “Time is money.” Usually spoken by a harried shopkeeper, snapping his fingers to get customers to make up their minds. “I don’t have all day.”

Turns out both are true. Time is money, and we don’t have all day. I didn’t appreciate this fully until I started my business. And it wasn’t because we charged an hourly rate for consulting work. It was because I realized the one thing I couldn’t get more of was time.

I could get more desks, more staff, more projects, more clients, even more ideas—but not more time. Your time, above all else, is a truly valuable and irreplaceable commodity.

So here’s what you have to do:

<strong>1.Don’t waste it</strong>—Don’t spend it on any projects or anything else that someone else could be doing or should be doing—and can do just as well or better. Instead, at work, spend it on the things only you can or should do. (And spend a lot of it away from work.)

<strong>2. Don’t let anyone else waste it for you</strong>—At work, if someone comes up to you and says something that sounds like “Can I annoy the living crap out of you about this thing I should be able to easily and quietly do myself?” You need to spot that from a distance. You have to be in control. Do you need to take that trip? That call? Go to that meeting? Ask the questions. And answer them.

<strong>3. Manage it</strong>—Just as you would any other money. Carefully. Put it where it will do the most good (read an article, listen to a podcast). Put some where it will bring you joy (a walk, a run, a jump in the lake). Share some (mentor, speak at a conference). Keep a little all to yourself (for a passion project like learning a second language or how to play an instrument).

<strong>4. And, of course, keep track of it</strong>—Not because we are slaves to timesheets and bill hourly.
But so you can review your day/week/month and plan the next ones. Are you spending the right amount of time on your business in general and are you spending the right amount of time with your best clients and on strategies for growth?

FULL DISCLOSURE: I’m kind of a nut about time. I plan pretty much every hour of every day (yes, including this one—don’t judge). That’s not for everyone. A calendar schedule book may be enough. But find the formula that works for you. When you do, I guarantee you will feel more productive—because you will be.","Entrepreneurial tips #3",2016-08-18,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/time-really-money/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MG_8156.jpg,"Time Really IS Money",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MG_8156.jpg,,Blog,Entrepreneurial,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,time-really-money,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
562,"The Most Badass Person I've Ever Met","This is a weird topic, but I'm going to dive in anyway because by now you know how I feel about extreme physical challenges, growing stronger through pain and pushing harder in a culture that wants everything quick and easy. I have run a marathon, been part of a team in an ultra marathon and participated in many intense, physically-challenging endurance events, such as the GoRuck Normandy HTL. That’s nothing compared to many men and women I’ve met along the way who have tackled much bigger, harder events.

But I have never in my life seen anything like the natural births of our sons Harlowe and Tennyson. And that’s all because of their totally badass mother — my wife, Elizabeth. She’s just unbelievable.

Nowadays, everybody wants everything fast, planned and painless. And giving birth is no exception. I'm not dissing that approach at all. Natural childbirth isn’t for everyone and I’m not a doctor. What I can tell you, from the point of view from a husband and father, is that the experience of natural childbirth is the most impressive physical feat you will ever witness.

Elizabeth (did I mention how much of a badass she is?) felt that she could train herself to deal with the pain. And she did. With Harlowe she used <a href=""http://www.birthingfromwithin.com/"">Birthing From Within</a> and with Tennyson last week she used <a href=""https://www.hypnobabies.com/"">Hypnobabies</a>, a meditation and self hypnosis technique.

They remain the most impressive physical feats I’ve ever seen with my own eyes. It was life-changing to witness our sons’ births and to see what a woman’s body can do. What it is made to do.

We live in such a softened society, most people would not even consider going this route. It makes me all the more proud of Elizabeth and awed by her that she did.

No pain, no gain? I’m not sure that applies. But I do think being able to endure pain makes you a stronger person.

For the sake of comparison, after Harlowe’s birth, Elizabeth didn’t even take a Tylenol. Her husband, on the other hand, was lying on his back in a cot taking Vicodin because his back hurt so badly.

Well, it did hurt! But I hadn’t given birth to so much as an idea that day, let alone a beautiful, healthy baby boy.

I was in awe of what Elizabeth did when she gave birth to Harlowe. Then last week she went and outdid herself by birthing Tennyson- without so much as a scream, or cry (until she saw him). Then she was home with Tennyson four hours later. That's insane to me.

A lot of thoughts race through your mind at a time like this - what will the boys be when they grow up? Who will they look like? Who knows???

One thing I do know for certain — they will have the smartest, strongest, sweetest, prettiest, most talented, most kind mother a kid could possibly want.

And, unquestionably; the most badass also.

Tennyson was born at the <a href=""http://www.charlestonbirthplace.com/"">Charleston Birth Place</a>, which is PHENOMENAL.

569,"Hire People Who Are Smarter Than You Are","<em><strong>Entrepreneurial Tips #4</strong></em>

One of the most difficult parts of growing your business is hiring. And I mean it’s difficult in every way. If you started your company small or by yourself (as I did), it;s difficult just to answer the nuts-and-bolts questions. Can I afford to hire anyone? If so, who? If so, when? Etc.

Once you can get past some of the cash flow/expense fears, and get beyond realizing the business is big or busy enough that you can’t do it all yourself any longer, you can finally consider a much more interesting question: <strong>what kind of people should I hire?</strong>

This idea of hiring people who are smarter than you are is something that can easily get in the way of your ego. And most entrepreneurs have a pretty healthy one.

But the alternative is to limit your company to the ability level you have (even if the level is high). That’s no alternative.

I think I am a pretty good writer, idea guy, strategist, planner, competitor, leader, fighter, ground game/grassroots guy. I’m not good with details, numbers, money, advertising reports, media analytics. So, other people do that at my company. Thank goodness.

<strong>I have been fortunate to hire several people who are not just smarter than I am—but are crazy smart.</strong> They have been (and continue to be) major reasons for the company’s success.

If you are still at the should I or shouldn't I phase—here are some things to consider:

-you should still be learning—everyone at your company should be. And bringing people on board who have different experiences and perspectives is a great way to learn.

-stop micromanaging. If you hire the right people, they should be able to do the jobs better than you ever could.

-by the same token, hiring smarter people can reduce your workload. They should learn faster, be more motivated and on top of their workloads.

-this can also help you grow as a leader.

-remember the 80/20 rule. 80% of your productivity comes from 20% of your work. The key is to either eliminate that 80% that doesn’t produce big results, or delegate them out to someone else. The only way to delegate is to have a team around you.

572,"Maintain A Work/Life Balance","<strong><em>Entrepreneurial tips #5</em></strong>

There is not a business Wesley and a home Wesley. There’s only one me. Frankly, I don’t have the time or desire or inclination to try to have different personas. But, like a lot of entrepreneurs, I do have a difficult time “turning it off.” The truth is, I like being busy. In fact—the busier, the better.

My wife and I have a two-year-old son and a baby boy due soon—so it will be busy at home. My digital communications firm does a lot of political work, and November in an even-numbered (and presidential) year is just around the corner. Plenty busy there. And our space is under construction because the craft brewery and gourmet pizza restaurant I co-own are both moving in with us. So, yes—this could potentially be crazy busy.

Here are some suggestions for how to balance it:

<strong>Schedule it</strong>—you don’t have to schedule all of the day every day as I do, but it works for me. And I set aside big chunks of time at home. If you don't schedule, you miss things. You forget things. The day can get away from you, then the week does, then the month…

<strong>Use technology</strong>—there are so many things that save me time and effort and help me organize my business and my personal life, like my virtual assistant. See what’s out there and put it work for you.

<strong>Remember you</strong>—you remember that person; the one you see in the mirror each morning. While you’re busy thinking abut your family and your employees and your friends and neighbors and relatives…remember to carve out (or, better yet, schedule!) some time for you. For me, that’s meditating, exercising, running and personal and spiritual growth. I also carve out half a workday out of the office to be alone and to do some thinking. Sometimes that’s on a beach, at a coffee shop or at a bar. Yours could be all different things—just make sure you do them. Again, they are easily compromised because “something else came up.” Guess what? Something else always comes up. But you'll be burned out if you don’t hike or get a massage or go to a museum. And you’re no good to anyone at home or at work if you’re burned out.

<strong>Delegate</strong>—That can be a hard thing to do as an entrepreneur. Another person might not do the task exactly as you would. True. But she might do it better. Delegate it.

<strong>Put family first</strong>--you’ll never be able to rewind the clock and see those first steps or hear those first words again. You’ll never get those minutes back where you could have been cuddled up with your wife. You’re not going to be on your deathbed wishing you would have made that happy hour on that one Tuesday night.

What’s the ideal work/life balance? I’ll let you know when I figure it out. But it’s something I work on every day. And I suggest you do the same. It’s worth it.","There is not a business Wesley and a home Wesley.

575,"HANDS-ON versus HANDS-OFF","<em><strong>Entrepreneurial tips #6</strong></em>

If you started your business as I did—with you as the only employee—of course you were a hands-on manager. What alternative was there? You did every task, and each one was done the way you thought it should be done.

But if your business has grown—as mine has—you reach a point where you can and should consider how hands-on you need to be.

Here are a few things I’ve learned:

<strong>Knowing everything versus Doing everything</strong>—It’s important to be as well-informed as possible as the company grows. It can be tricky getting to know everything you should know as opposed to every last detail. Be as clear as possible with your direct reports. Potential client problem—tell me. Detail? Handle it. And, while there is a temptation to be looking over everyone’s shoulder, or wanting them do it just like you do it, if you’ve hired the right people, let them work.

<strong>Keep some tasks for yourself</strong>—If your company ever gets to the size where it is too complex or too busy for you to be able to do at least some of the kind of work that inspired you to open your business in the first place…it may be time to reconsider things. What I enjoy the most are developing communications strategies, and writing. I generally still get to do a fair amount of both. So—delegate. Just don’t delegate everything.

<strong>What hands-off tells employees</strong>—If your style is hands-off, at least most of the time (for example, you may be more involved with new hires or a big new business opportunity), you are telling your employees you trust them and they are empowered to make decisions. Your employees are generally happier, more fulfilled, more productive and more confident as a result.

<strong>Micromanaging OR Macromanaging</strong>—Which are you? A t-crosser or a big picture person?
The truth is, depending on the size and age of your company, you may need to be a bit of both. Show you are willing and able to roll up your sleeves at a moment’s notice, and show you are thinking three steps ahead. Your employees will appreciate both.

579,"Always Be Moving","<em><strong>Entrepreneurial Tips #7</strong></em>

Your car can operate in neutral. It won’t get anywhere, but it can operate. It’s running.

If your business is in neutral, you're sunk. If there is anything I’ve learned starting and managing businesses, it’s this: always be moving. It’s one of my top business mantras and I repeat it to myself daily. If I find myself getting tired, zoning out or surfing the web, I tell myself exactly what I say to myself when I’m running - don’t stop, keep moving.

It can be scary. There is a temptation to have one more meeting or do more analysis before any decision. I’m not suggesting Ready-Fire-Aim. What I am suggesting is Full Speed Ahead.

Here are some things to consider:

Set the example—If you are sitting around on your big ass all day long, what do you think your employees will do? Get moving. And keep moving. And they will.

Make decisions—When you run a business, you make decisions constantly. Big and small. And some people just can’t get used to that. You have to turn yourself into a fast analysis machine. Trust your gut. Make the decision. And move on.

Move and shake—There’s a reason why some business people are called movers and shakers. Because that’s what we need to do. Make things happen. Shake things up. Not just for the heck of it. Because it needs to be done. A new product A new process. A new lead. A new distribution channel.

Set deadlines and goals—Sounds kind of obvious, right? But a deadline for everything and a goal for everything—keeps everything (and everyone) moving.

583,"Get Pumped For Running Season","<h2>A fitness update</h2>
Running season is officially here. A few weeks ago I began transitioning from rucking back to running by slowly increasing my mileage each week. Last week was the first hard training week with a total of five runs adding up to thirty-five miles, including a ten miler and some garage work (because hill work is nearly impossible in the SC lowcountry). My goal is to get 41 miles in next week . I want to be up to 50 miles a week before the Savannah Rock and Roll Marathon in November.

<strong>My Race Schedule</strong>

Savannah Rock and Roll Marathon: Nov 5
Sweet Tea Half Marathon: Nov 12
Kiawah Marathon: Dec 10
Asheville Marathon: March 12
Palmetto 200: March 24

<strong>My Running Goals</strong>

1. Really follow a strict running plan this time, unlike my last marathon
2. Be running 50 miles a week a month prior to Savannah
3. Finish Savannah under 4 hours
4. Finish Kiawah under 3:45
5. Finish Charleston under 3:30
6. Possibly go for a BQ in Asheville

I also began a mental transition this week. If you’ve read my blog frequently you know that I put a big emphasis on mental training. You gotta get yo mind right for endurance events. That counts for training too. A motivated brain is a well trained body. This week I began rereading Hal Higdon's Marathon, I read the last three editions of Runners World magazine, I listened to two Runners World podcasts and I listened to Eric Orton’s the Cool Impossible while running. I'm motivated to run when my brain is thinking of running.

As for diet, I'm playing with a few different things right now, including some new pre run foods. I'll write separately on that soon.

I hope to see you on the road soon,

I could host a Facebook Live event with our fantastic ad director Brooke Willaby and take questions and answer them live. 

No flight, no waiting in airport, no hotel, no seminar. And get your questions answered about everything digital. 

This was the first one and we'll be doing more. Watch and enjoy.

593,"Work Hard, Relax Hard","<em><strong>Entrepreneurial tips #8</strong></em>

I think I have the first part down pretty well.

I work hard.

Always have. Always will. I like a crazy-ass schedule more than anything.

And my “free time” is often just as intense as work. Between F3 workouts and GORUCK events and training for and competing in marathons and ultra marathons, I’m usually up early and carrying a utility pole around or running ten miles before most people have coffee. And obviously, even more important, I'm trying to be a good husband and father, which is oftentimes the furthest thing from relaxing.

But the truth is, you need a break. Everyone does. So—if you are running or starting a business and your life is generally nuts— when and how can you relax?

Here are some ideas that have worked for me:

<strong>SCHEDULE</strong>—You need to plan that time like you plan time for everything else. If you don’t, it won’t get done. Simple as that.

<strong>MEDITATE</strong>—Don’t roll you eyes. You don't need to have incense burning. It’s a few minutes twice a day. TOTAL relaxation and TOTAL concentration. My day is no good without it.

<strong>TAKE A NAP</strong>—I don’t nap the all the time—just when I need to. Your body will tell you. Listen.

<strong>YOGA</strong>—Besides being good exercise generally and great for flexibility specifically, yoga really does have all the other benefits people won’t shut up about—it relaxes you, it slows things down, and it centers you.

<strong>BREATHE</strong>—Read up on how to control your breathing, and how to use that to help control your emotions, your mood and your energy. Seriously. You wouldn’t think anything as routine or basic as breathing could do all of that, but it can.

<strong>READ</strong>—Sometimes I wonder if reading is going to disappear like cursive writing. Can’t I just listen to an audio book. Or, better yet, a podcast? You can—and I do—but reading is extremely relaxing. Beyond the benefits of knowledge, there is something really pleasurable about reading.

<strong>SPIRITUALITY</strong>—It doesn’t have to be an reorganized religion. It doesn’t have to be religion for that matter. But taking some time to read about or think about or listen to spiritual topics is time well spent. The world is bigger than today’s 3 o’clock meeting. It’s good to be reminded of that.

<strong>DO SOMETHING FOR YOU</strong>—You may be overloaded with stress and demands from running a business as well as family commitments. But you can’t forget you. Make sure you set aside some time to listen to music, binge watch a favorite show, take a walk. Do it.

One final note: some of us feel guilty about relaxing. Don’t. You’ve earned it. You need it. Unplug for a bit, recharge your batteries, and then get after it.","Entrepreneurial tips #8",2016-09-07,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/work-hard-relax-hard/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/895835_10101416215265177_382039392_o.jpg,"Work Hard, Relax Hard",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/895835_10101416215265177_382039392_o.jpg,,Blog,Entrepreneurial,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,work-hard-relax-hard,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

599,"Sluggish Body Means Sluggish Mind","<em><strong>Entrepreneurial tips #9</strong></em>

Garbage in, garbage out. You’ve heard that. The term comes from computer science, and it makes sense. Of course if you put the wrong stuff in, you’ll get the wrong stuff out.

But it also applies to humans. And for us, it’s even worse.

Put the wrong stuff in your body—snacks, soda—and you get lazy as well as overweight and unhealthy. Worse—your brain turns to mush. Domino effect.

If your body’s not working right, it means your mind’s not working right—which means you’re not working right. And that isn’t good.

So how can you prevent it? Try some of these:

<strong>SLEEP ENOUGH</strong>—There is a temptation when you are a driven individual with a business to run and a family, etc. to short yourself on sleep. Don’t. Not everyone needs the same amount. But we all need sleep. Get you some! If you work out hard, remember that your body is repairing itself when you're sleeping. No sleep means no repair.

<strong>EAT RIGHT</strong>—You don’t have to go crazy and stop everything and just eat tofu. Start by cutting out known bad things a little at a time, especially at work. I started by cutting out sugar--no soda, no snacks and, the hardest of all, no sugar in my coffee. Then I cut out dairy; again, coffee being the hardest part for me. Next I gave up most processed foods and, at one point, I even gave up meat for a few months. I added a ton of fruits and veggies. None of that happened overnight. I took it one step at a time.

<strong>GET OUTSIDE</strong>—Depending on where you live, this could be easy or difficult year round, but you need to do it. There’s no substitute for fresh air and sunshine (remember—the sun is always out, even if it’s not sunny). Walk around. You’ll feel better. And you’ll think better.

<strong>EXERCISE</strong>—Duh. If you feel sluggish, get moving! Get outside (see ^ above), get to the gym or do some exercise at work. Doesn’t have to be an intense, physically demanding balls-out workout (although mine are!)—you just need to do something. And it’s amazing what a positive, immediate effect even a little exercise will have on your body and your mind.

<strong>DO RESEARCH</strong>—I’m not a doctor, so I asked mine. I also asked my chiropractor. And I read books. About diet, about nutrition, about sleep, about exercise, even about breathing…there’s information all over the place. Find it. Use it.

Even when you do these things, if you have a busy schedule and are up early, you may still get a little fatigued around noon or one or two. It’s natural to “hit a wall” during the workday (just like in a marathon). Heres my advice:

Hit back.

604,"I Hit A Wall Again And I’m Feeling Depressed About It","<em><strong>My weekly fitness update</strong></em>

As always, I’m giving you my weekly fitness update. This time it isn’t good. I’m honestly in a bit of a funk, or as my F3 brother Goose calls it, I’m fighting the foo and losing.

It’s happened to me twice before. I get to training hard. I’m focused. I’m feeling the fire. I’m making tons of progress. Then BOOM! I go down with an illness.

This time I got a nasty cold, starting last Tuesday, which developed into something worse like bronchitis. I don’t know exactly what I have because I haven’t been to the doctor. I’ve been curing it with a lot more sleep, no alcohol, natural remedies and a week off from working out.

Okay, that last part isn’t true. I ran five milers on Saturday and Sunday because I thought I was getting better. It just made me worse. I’ve been hacking up nastiness for days now. I have no energy. And I’m just downright depressed.

Obviously I’m off my training plan, hoping the time off will get me back on the road faster. I just don’t understand why this keeps happening. Every time I get in the zone and train hard, my immune system crashes. I’m eating healthy. I’m drinking a ton of water. I’m sleeping. I’m taking vitamins. I got blood work done and nothing is really off there except iron, which I’ve fixed through supplements. The only thing I can think of is too much booze, the extreme stress I put myself through with work or a combination of everything.

This weekend Elizabeth ran into one of my F3 brothers at the grocery store and he said that I’m known in our circles for getting sick.  That’s not the rep I want. I want to be known as the guy who trains hard and accomplishes badass shit. But that’s not what I am. I’m the guy hacking up green gunk all day at work and not able to run the 45 miles I need this week to meet my marathon goals.

Anyway, as you can tell, I’m pretty down on myself right now. I pray I wake up tomorrow morning feeling awesome because I really need to get eight miles in.

608,"Only Do The Tasks That Only You Can Do","<em><strong>Entrepreneurial tips #10</strong></em>

If you’ve been following my tips, you’ve read about ways to be more productive, the importance of scheduling and delegating and how to manage your energy throughout the workday.

The remaining question is: which things should you be doing?

If you follow the Pareto Principle (the 80/20 rule) as I do, you should be well on your way to figuring this out. If 20% of your time produces 80% of your company's results, if 20% of your customers represent 80% of your sales--where should your focus be? You know the answer.

So if there is someone in your office—or a contractor or freelancer—who can do some of the things you’re currently doing better or less expensively, have that person do those things. Concentrate on the 20%--eliminate or delegate the 80%.

<strong>Only do the things only you can do.</strong>

Simple to say, not as simple to put onto practice. How about the things you're good at and passionate about that caused you to start the business in the first place?

Your company may have grown in size or complexity to the degree that you have to set an example of what you want to be done, or give your approval to the work, or outline in broad strokes how important tasks should be accomplished… instead of doing them.

Or your company may still be growing (and having growing pains) but you need to be laser-focused on one thing: like sales. Do that and sub out the other work.

In either case, it may be time for you to back away from hands-on involvement with writing proposals, or coming up with a plan, or creating a prototype or testing recipes or whatever it is that makes your business go.

<strong>Because the truth is—what really makes your business go, is you.</strong> And your number one priority is to keep it going. Growing, moving forward, making improvements.

You’re the entrepreneur. That’s your job now. And you need to do it with as much passion and energy as you poured into getting this far.

<em>That’s</em> how you’ll get to the next level.

611,"Things That Drive Me Batshit Crazy","Common courtesy is no longer common—at least not in business, and not with email.

I don’t get it.

I’m busy, too. But you don’t have 20 seconds to type “No thank you” or “Can’t meet today” and press “send”? Really?

Only an asshole doesn’t respond to emails. It’s not just rude or disrespectful—it’s lazy.

It would be different if I were sending out “I just made 900 dollars an hour at home with Google” or whatever the latest spam scam is that hits your inbox.

But I’m writing to people about business—people I’ve met with—people who have initiated a conversation or meeting with me—who then don’t respond to follow-up emails.

Worse, I’m sending emails to people with whom I am currently doing business—and I get no reply. That’s “Does 10:30 tomorrow work?” and no reply. Seriously.

And, yes, the final category is people my company actually pays…who don’t respond. They seem to accept the money without any problem. It’s hitting “reply” that seems to be an excessive burden.

Email silence is passive aggressive and cowardly. It’s as though no response is “the new no.” It’s “sofa king” aggravating.

And, in some ways, slow response time is worse than no response at all. Responding days, weeks or even months later says “you’re not important to me” loud and clear. Response time is a non-verbal cue that speaks volumes about you as a person.

Please, people. Please. Email is already faceless. We’re not on the phone, we’re not sitting across from each other. But must it be discourteous?

How about this—how about setting up some time each day to go through email? Use an email management system if you need to (there are several out there). Be honest if you’ve missed some messages because of workload. Include something in your signature about when you normally reply. Check your spam folder. Do something.

It’s OK to respond with “no.” It’s OK to respond with “I’m sorry.” What’s not OK is not responding. It’s simply unacceptable. You’re in the business world. Even if you’re young, you’re an adult. Act like one.

Look, I get a gazillion emails. Really. But I try it answer people who write me. I may miss one. I may plan to respond later and forget. But I don’t plan to ignore anyone.

And I really don’t appreciate the asshats who ignore me.","#3  People Who Don’t Reply to Emai",2016-09-16,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/things-drive-batshit-crazy-2/,,,,,,,,Blog,crazy|email,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,things-drive-batshit-crazy-2,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-15
616,"It's All About Making Decisions","<em><strong>Entrepreneurial tips #11</strong></em>

Making decisions is the blocking and tackling of being an entrepreneur.

If you want to start a business, plan on making a lot of decisions, making them quickly and making them on all kinds of topics.

In addition to running a digital communications firm, I am part owner of a craft brewery and a gourmet pizza restaurant. So, in the same hour sometimes, I might be making decisions about email strategy, growlers and pepperoni.

We are also building out our space to bring all three companies together—so now there are also many, many decisions to be made about permits, subcontractors, flooring…the list goes on.

To me, effective decision making requires two things: courage and intuition.

I want information but not mountains of it. I think people who are reluctant to make decisions keep asking for more data and more reports to put off making one. Not me,

Make a decision, and move on. You really have to trust your gut (it got you this far, didn't it?)

Here are a few other suggestions:

<strong>Do what’s right</strong>—Always good advice, true? With decisions, I mean this: what is right for our clients? What is right for our company? What works best for our employees? (And, finally) What is best for me? It aligns and makes the decision clear most of the time.

<strong>Get advice</strong>—You make the decision, not the committee or someone else. But if you’re lucky enough (as I am) to be surrounded by smart, trustworthy people, ask for their perspective. You will likely get a good range from “worst-case scenario” to ”rose-colored glasses”—including things you hadn’t considered.

<strong>Analyze</strong>—You’ll be able to gauge the results of your decisions pretty easily. But it’s worth the time and effort to do some analysis. Not to beat yourself up or to take a victory lap—just to help you in the future. What went right? What went wrong? What could I do differently?

<strong>Don’t wait</strong>—In an ideal world, you’d have plenty of time, all the pertinent information and a comfortable seat outside on a breezy day while you decide. In the actual world, you have to make decisions while being distracted by a million other things, maybe with the clock running down, and when you aren’t feeling well. You can’t wait for the perfect time. Decide.","Entrepreneurial tips #11",2016-09-19,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/its-all-about-making-decisions/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-4.49.26-PM.jpg,"It's All About Making Decisions",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-4.49.26-PM.jpg,,Blog,"Entrepreneurial tips #11",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,its-all-about-making-decisions,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
620,"You Can Catch More Flies With Honey Than With Vinegar (Usually)","<b>Entrepreneurial tips #12</b>

You’ve heard this old expression, right?  Everyone has. It simply means you are more likely to get what you want by being polite than by being rude.

But not always.

As a business owner/entrepreneur, it’s easy to be polite—especially if you were raised that way. Say “please,” hold the door open, offer to pay for lunch, send “thank you” notes. However, it’s not always easy—or advisable—to <i>manage</i> that way.

Sometimes, you have to say “this needs to be done today” instead of “when you can work this into your schedule, is it possible you could…?” And I’lll be honest, when I’m direct (and that’s often), it is frequently perceived as rude. That may be me, that may be how the nuance of language is lost when you are texting or messaging instead of speaking.

I don’t mean it to be rude. I mean it to be clear. Whether we like to admit it or not, we all work better with deadlines, performance metrics and expectations.

We have a chain of command at work that leads to me. Everyone knows who is in charge. But my employees are empowered and encouraged to make decisions, and we also work through a lot of issues collaboratively—particularly me with my senior staff.

A few more thoughts:

<b>NEGOTIATIONS</b>—This is a process where honey is very valuable as long as it is genuine.

<b>CLIENTS, VENDORS, BUSINESS ASSOCIATES</b>—-A consistently positive and (usually!) pleasant attitude builds relationships that last. You cannot believe (sometimes, <i>I</i> cannot believe) how many good business suggestions or leads I get from people I’ve known for years. And sometimes right out of the clear blue sky.

<b>ENCOURAGEMENT</b>—Costs nothing to give, yet is very valuable.

<b>DIPLOMACY</b>—Humble in victory, graceful in defeat. I get that from coaches, but we have political clients and it’s important (but difficult) to keep that in mind. Of course I want to win.

Every time. And of course I want our clients to win every time. But the world doesn't work that way. And being vengeful or angry doesn’t change the results. Go back to sports—shake hands and move on.

So…what will it be?  Honey?  Or vinegar?  The truth is, you need both. Just be careful measuring.","So…what will it be?  Honey?  Or vinegar?  The truth is, you need both.

624,"Push Harder","<em><strong>Entrepreneurial tips #13</strong></em>

The name of my blog is Push Harder.

It’s also my philosophy. And that’s why I’m finishing my entrepreneurial tips with it.

Pushing harder has served me well. To be clear, I don’t mean being pushy or annoying. I mean always being willing to take that extra step; to convince yourself you have the energy or the stamina or the talent to knock on one more door, or run one more mile or contact one more new business lead.

I have worked around politics since I was a teenager. Of course I always want my candidate to win. But it’s not possible to win every time. And while we might get outspent on a campaign, I won’t be outworked.

I pushed harder at my grocery store job, in my lower-rung positions at the statehouse in Columbia, in college, at the political jobs I had and most definitely with my own company.

No surprise—it’s called Push.

If you’ve read my blog you know that I also participate in a lot of endurance events through F3, through GoRuck and on my own with marathon training and the events. I started participating in these events for two reasons: (1) both my parents died young and I’d prefer not to, so I have committed myself to better health and nutrition, and (2) to see if I could. To push myself.

Completing my first marathon, surviving the HTL GORUCK Normandy event, finishing some of these F3 challenges—all of these have given me more confidence and a greater sense of satisfaction. In each case, I pushed harder and, guess what? It worked.

If you are thinking about starting a business or you already have, consider this: you will often be around people with more money or more experience or more connections. Here’s the thing—your secret weapon is you. That’s the one thing THEY don’t have.

What you can control is how you approach things. How prepared you are, how much energy you bring, your attitude—these things really do make all the difference. All the time.

Two words of advice.

627,"I'm Back And It Feels Awesome","<em><strong>My weekly fitness update</strong></em>

After a couple crappy weeks of being down physically, which put me down emotionally, I’m back on my feet, picking up mileage and almost feeling like the Wesley of 2015 again.

Last week I hit 37 total miles, which is the most I’ve hit in a while. My longest run was 11 miles. As I write this post, it’s Tuesday night and I’ve already hit 25 miles (my week begins on Sunday), including a fun 5k super hero run tonight.

My goal for the week is 45, but if I push it hard, I might be able to hit 50. My body feels great, except for some shin splint issues I’ve never had before. My endurance is way up and I seem to have been able to push past the low energy issue. I’m eating way more and I’m taking some new organic pills that do something with my mitochondria. I have no idea. I’m just doing what my nutritionist says to do. I’ll get more info and report back.

This morning I ran 7.5 miles in 100% humidity. It’s killing me and making it almost impossible to train for a marathon. To combat the crappy weather I’ve been putting a lot more miles in on the treadmill. It gets boring, but I’ve fought that with my iPad and a few good shows. On Sunday I put in 10 miles worth of South Park. As a side note, the new season is as funny as last season and pretty much explains the BS my company has to deal with on a daily basis. Watch it.

Aside from the running, I’m trying to get one F3 bootcamp and two heavy weight days in at the gym each week.

My body feels great and my spirits are high. I’ll be ready for the Savannah Rock and Roll Marathon if I keep progressing this way. I pray that my body stays healthy and my mind remains focused.

640,"Feeling Great But Gimpy","<em><strong>My Weekly Fitness Update</strong></em>

You'll hear many cliches come from my mouth, two of which are ""push through the pain"" and ""listen to your body.""

The problem is that many times those two cliches are contradictory. While you should push through the pain during an event, that's not a smart move while training. Injuries tend to get worse and what could have been a couple days down can become much longer.

That's what I'm facing right now. As I write this post, I'm taking a couple days off during a week I should be going very hard. After going 50.9 miles last week, I've developed some pain in my left leg all around the top of the leg and throughout my knee. I could push through it but I'm afraid it will just get worse and I'll really screw up my marathon training, which I'm behind on as it is. Also there's a hurricane coming our way, so my weekend long run is sure to get screwed up.

I know what you’re thinking. My fitness updates have been a rollercoaster. That’s how I feel, too. One week my body feels great. The next week week it feels broken. This week it feels somewhere in the middle. I feel great but I can tell something is happening with my leg and I just want to be careful.

Aside from the 50 miles last week, I lifted twice and hit two F3 bootcamps. This week I’ll be closer to 35 miles, 1 F3 bootcamp and 3 gym days.

Mentally, I’m in a good place. The weather feels better and I feel focused. Not running for a couple days is killing me because, for the first time in months, I actually really want to run.

I’m going to add more stretching into my daily routine. I’m hoping that will help the leg and prevent additional injury as I go hard for the fall and winter runs.

As for my goals, here’s where my mind is today:

<strong>Savannah Rock and Roll Marathon (November)</strong>: I’m going to take it easy and treat it as a long training run with a goal of under 4 hours. I’m not going to stress about this one because I’m behind on my training. I’ll treat this as part of my training for the next runs.

<strong>Sweet Tea Half Marathon (November):</strong> This is the week after Savannah and I have a goal of absolutely crushing it and beating last year’s time of 1:43:27 (7:53 pace)

<strong>Kiawah Marathon (December):</strong> I’m going hard here. I want a 3:45 race.

<strong>Charleston Marathon (January):</strong> I’m going hard here, too. I want a 3:40 race.

<strong>Asheville Marathon (March)</strong>: I’m shooting for 3:30.

<strong>P200 Ultra (March):</strong> Just ten days after Asheville, this is one of my favorite races of the year. I’ll be doing another six-man ultra team with a goal of beating last year’s time.

I should also note that I have a GORUCK Heavy in February also.

Thanks for reading!

644,"YOU IN 2016: Political Tips You Can Use In Everyday Life","At the height of the campaign season, I had this idea that many of the things I do naturally—because I’ve been working in politics for 20 years—might help people who don't work in politics (often referred to as “sane people.”) By that, I mean it might help you in your neighborhood, at your church or at work, or when it’s time for PTA meetings.

I don’t know why this occurred to me during the absolute busiest time of year for a political firm, but it did. I really do think many of these tips about motivating volunteers and getting your message out are easy to apply in other situations.

And I am always happy to help. Sometimes one suggestion can make a big difference at the office or at home. I hope you found the tips enjoyable and useful.

648,"You Cannot Do It Alone","<strong><em>YOU IN 2016: Political tips you can use in everyday life: Part One</em></strong>

As promised, this is the first in a series of learnings from the campaign trail you can apply to the workplace or your relationships with family and friends. I’m doing this ”journal style”—a little more informally, just as if we were having a conversation on a drive. Hope you will enjoy.

<strong>MOTIVATING PEOPLE</strong> — You don’t get far in a political campaign (or a neighborhood project or a complicated/last-minute/weekend/unpleasant work
task) without volunteers. People volunteer for a variety of reasons, but motivating and keeping them motivated takes effort.

Make sure they see the bigger reason. They aren't getting involved to help you or even themselves. They are in it for the bigger cause. In campaigns such as the many important US Senate races this year, volunteers should get involved to stop the Democrats from taking back the US Senate (remember, I'm a GOP strategist). In my workout group, F3, men worked all weekend to help their neighbors clean up after Hurricane Matthew. They knew they weren't in F3 just to get fit. They're there to better our community, too.

The next really important thing is <strong>recognition</strong>. Let’s face it—in everyday life, few of us are the quarterback whose team just won the Super Bowl, or the rock star, or the President of the United States. We’re not getting the balloon drop, the Gatorade shower or the laser show and confetti cannons. But you would be surprised how much good a little thing like remembering to say, “We couldn’t have done it without Betsy” does. Be as thoughtful as you can be about knowing who to thank (meaning don’t leave anyone out) and when and how. But it can be as simple as a group email or a short talk with the team.

<strong>Appreciation</strong> goes a step beyond recognition. You're not just telling someone they did a great job. You're telling them how much that great job meant to you and to the cause. You're giving them the bigger reason behind the recognized task. You can take this even one step further by saying ""I appreciate you"" instead of ""I appreciate what you just did."" Let people know that you appreciate them as people instead of just as machine who completed a given task.

No campaign can be won by a single person. Neither can most of life's big tasks. Change takes many people. Rally your troops with a cause, recognition and appreciation.","No campaign can be won by a single person. Neither can most of life's big tasks. Change takes many people.

652,"It All Begins With The Right Message","<strong>YOU IN 2016: Political Tips You Can Use In Everyday Life: Part Two</strong>

Here are some more ideas you can use to win at home, at work, in your neighborhood, etc.

<strong>MESSAGING</strong>—It’s crucial in politics to have a SHORT message about who the candidate is (in this case, who you are). Similarly, if it is a ballot proposal or an issue advocacy position, you have to explain it in three words. Four if necessary. Okay, maybe seven like in the picture above.

Yes, in politics you will have many, many other things and you will have longer policy statements and positions and press releases. But to start, you need a catchy, concise message.

One of my favorites is for South Carolina Senator Shane Massey. “Shake Up Columbia.” Three words, easy to understand, provocative and positive. Whoever wrote that is a freakin’ genius!

This is the same messaging format YOU need to motivate your team, to rally the neighbors, to convince your family about a major decision. And you don’t need yard signs—it’s enough to say it and remind people. BUILD THE PLAYGROUND. BUY THE COTTAGE. FINISH THE PROPOSAL. The messages could also be for a general theme or goal and not just a task. NO MORE WEEKENDS (meaning work harder/smarter during the week). YES TO DESSERT (if vegetables eaten first). EVERY IDEA COUNTS (to generate more).

In a pinch, you can try one that rhymes.

But instead of the “elevator speech”—which is helpful but long—this is a good way to simplify and clarify your objective. Shorter than a tweet. Shorter than a billboard. NOT “I intend to go to our state capital after the election and start a process whereby I will challenge the status quo and… ”

INSTEAD: Shake Up Columbia.

657,"Find People Who Get Sh*t Done And You Can Accomplish Just About Anything","<em><strong>YOU IN 2016: Political Tips You Can Use In Everyday Life Part 3</strong></em>

Here’s the next installment of suggestions, direct from the campaign trail to your desk or kitchen table. It’s all about people who get sh...things done.

In digital politics and in marketing, who are we looking for? Who do we need? I could give you a half-hour on field communications structure, but I'll make it simple and quick. We want people who get sh*t done.

So, how does that relate to you? You’re also looking for the same people. You just have a smaller universe and easier access. Think of it this way: if you’re at a PTA meeting, or a church men’s group meeting or some ad hoc group meeting at work, the same people show up. Guy who talks too much. Guy who never talks. Guy who questions everything. Not-paying-attention guy. Do it my way guy. Right? The people you’re looking for are the ones who drive action—the roll your sleeves up, get your hands dirty, follow me people. The people other people listen to. Those are the people you have to get on your side.

When you have a project to tackle, would it be ideal to have more time or more money? Sure it would. But what really helps? People you can count on to get sh*t done. They volunteer. Better yet, they're self starters. They set the chairs up before the meeting. Bring their rakes or chain saws around to all the houses on the street after a big windstorm. They make the calls or pass out the mailers. First to arrive. Last to leave. No complaints. No questions. No excuses. And, believe me--worth their weight in gold.

Need a real life example? My wife. She's on everyone's short list in the community. Groups, boards, whatever. Everyone wants her involved because she is constantly marking items off the todo list, always crossing the finish line. No excuses. No delays. Just progress and completion. She's the person you can absolutely count on to get shit done.

Get yourself an army of people who bust their asses at church events, at the gym, at children's activities, at work, in the community--and you can accomplish anything. More time or a bigger budget is nothing compared to that kind of energy and work ethic.

When push comes to shove, take my advice: get more people who know how to get sh*t done. Trust me. You won't be sorry.

Until next time—

660,"I Get Knocked Down But I Get Up Again","I didn’t post my weekly fitness update last week because I was sulking and whining like a little punk. Yep, I went down again. It wasn’t an illness this time. It was some serious pain in my right leg.

Three weeks ago I crushed it hard with 51 miles in one week. My leg started bothering me toward the end of the week but I finished out with a 13-miler anyway. You know, that whole ""push through the pain"" mentality. That was a mistake.

I went down hard. Pain started in my knee and crept up to the top of my leg and around my thigh. It was pretty strange because it would hurt in difference places throughout the day. Often, especially in the morning, I couldn’t put any pressure on my leg at all. Being busy with a newborn, a two-year-old, a hurricane an an election, I didn’t go to the doctor and instead self-diagnosed as having an IT band injury. I prescribed to myself 10 days off and use of one of those roller things.

It seems to have worked. My leg isn’t pain free yet, but I was able to knock out two four-milers and an eight-miler this week so far (it’s Tuesday).

So where does that leave my event schedule? Unfortunately I’ve made the decision to drop from the Savannah Rock and Roll Marathon to the half marathon. The following week will be the Sweet Tea half marathon in Summerville, SC and in December I’ll have the Kiawah Marathon. I’m a little disappointed that I’ll only get two marathons in this year, but that was my goal anyway so I can’t cry too much.

Hopefully I’ll remain illness and injury-free for the remainder of the year and crush what’s left of 2017. Thanks for reading!

663,"Understanding Your Audience","<b>YOU IN 2016:  Political Tips You Can Use In Everyday Life: Part Four</b>

A common mistake people used to make in business (and, frankly, still do) is looking at the marketplace in terms of what they want to sell, rather than what people want to buy.

In other words, totally not understanding the audience.

Well, the truth is—that happens a lot. And it happens a lot not just in business and in politics but also in our other relationships, such as with our families, friends and neighbors.

So how do you find out what is important to your audience? If you were chief digital strategist for a presidential campaign (as I was this cycle) you’d rely on polling. Of course, the size of our total audience was 325,000,000. You probably have a more manageable group.

Sometimes it’s as simple as a show of hands. But there’s something about privacy and anonymity that people really like, just as they typically like being asked their opinion. So ask.

Again, depending on your group, a simple one-page questionnaire would work. At the office, it might be better to use something like Survey Monkey which works really well.

You also have your intuition and your gut and don’t discount those. Not very scientific, but often right.

But, one way or another, you need to get the answer. It’ll save you from spending time and/or money on the wrong message. I've been there. Law and order message to electorate whose #1 interest is jobs. Etc. Don't make that mistake.

Is your neighborhood more interested in beautification or safety? Does the local school need a new playground, or more tablets? Is everyone interested in new furniture at the office, or would they rather have a more flexible work schedule? Is the extended family yearly vacation a done deal, or is there room for discussion?

Find out—and act accordingly.

666,"Things That Drive Me Batshit Crazy #3","<em><strong>Keyboard Courage</strong></em>

OK, this has to stop. “Keyboard Courage” is driving me out of my frigging mind.

I’m not sure if it’s because it can be done anonymously on the internet, or just because it can be done without looking at another person eye-to-eye, but this “type anything to anyone” mentality is totally out of control.

Maybe the election year has made things worse—I don’t know.  But I <i>do</i> know I see the most vile, nasty, hateful, foul comments just about everywhere. These are from people who you know would NEVER in a million years say something like this to anyone’s face.

I think spending hours online writing awful and rude comments makes some people feel brave, but it’s the very definition of cowardice.

That the level of discourse in this country has dropped to the sub-basement is troubling, to say the least. It isn’t just no courtesy, it’s no civility.

You support another candidate?  Fine. You have a different opinion on an issue?  Also fine.

What are you accomplishing with six hours on news sites typing every swear word you know?

You’re just bullying people online.

Please: trolls, angry people, activists—think of something else to do. Or have the courage to say it to a person's face where you may have to suffer the consequences of your actions. You have the right to free speech. But no one said free speech doesn't come without a cost, like you getting put on the ground.

Which reminds me of another thing that drives me absolutely batshit crazy-- people who don't understand that the 1st Amendment protects you from the government, not from someone's fist.

668,"Delaying Your Way To Failure","<strong>YOU IN 2016: Political Tips You Can Use In Everyday Life: Part Five</strong>

You probably heard the advice first when you were little: “Never put off to tomorrow, what you can do today.” It’s true. It’s especially true in campaigns. To say you need a sense of urgency to work on political campaigns is putting it mildly. We have to work like there’s no tomorrow because there may not be. One wrong move, one bad debate, one new opponent…and the campaign could be over. You just never know. So you just can’t afford to wait.

That’s good advice at work, at home, in your neighborhood and with your friends and family.
Don’t wait. Don’t wait “for the timing to be better.” Don’t wait for “someone else to do it.” Somebody should see about getting a stop sign on your street. Not somebody. You.
Somebody should plan a party. Somebody should buy a gift for the teacher. Somebody should start thinking about new audience targets for the company’s products. Not tomorrow. Today.

Sounds like “somebody’s” going to be busy. But, seriously—what’s the alternative? Wait and see if someone else does it? Wait and see how it turns out? No, no,no. Bad plan. Believe me—days make weeks, and weeks make months. It happens in the blink of an eye.

Take the initiative. Raise your hand. Say “I’ve got this one.” Besides the obvious (task being accomplished), you’ll feel more fulfilled personally, and people will see as being dependable.

But whatever else you do—at work, at home, at church, in the neighborhood—do it now.
Don’t delay.

671,"VERY true: It's Not What You Know. It's Who You Know","<em><strong>YOU IN 2016: Political Tips You Can Use in Everyday Life: Part Six</strong></em>

In politics, you might be surprised how much happens simply because of relationships. And I don’t mean secret, backroom, you-scratch-my-back relationships. I mean actual friends, neighbors, former co-workers…it’s the next segment of campaign lessons you can adapt for work, home and family.

What compels someone to run for office? What then compels other people to volunteer or be supporters? As often as not, it’s relationships we have that drive these decisions. I have worked on many campaigns at the request or suggestion of people I’ve known for quite some time. And many of the candidates I know well ran in the first place because a friend or neighbor or family member urged them to. Yes, they have a sense of duty as regards public service and feel they have skills to offer as well. But an older or more experienced person offering support makes a big difference.

The same is true in the (non-political campaign) workplace. We used to collect stacks of business cards to keep track of our contacts—it is so much more efficient now. And you just never know when that person you interviewed with once, met at a party, have a mutual friend with at church—turns out to be your next big lead, big sale or big promotion.

All the more reason to do two things consistently. First, treat people well. Ever heard somebody say “be nice to people on the way up—you’ll see the same people on the way down”? I think really it just means be polite. To everyone. I’ve worked around people who were just awful to anyone in a service capacity—waiter, checkout person. That’s bad karma. And bad manners. Second, keep in touch. Not annoyingly. But back to the “you never know” thing—that’s why it’s a good idea to wish people a happy birthday or send a funny story you know they’ll like. As long as it’s sincere (and not like how people reached out to me on LinkedIn!), that’s a kind of thing people remember. I have people who still remind me what a nice note I sent when one of their parents passed.

Relationships. They need care and nurturing, like most things in life.","It’s All About Relationships",2016-10-26,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/2016-political-tips-can-use-everyday-life-part-six/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_6124.jpg,"VERY true: It's Not What You Know.

675,"Production Is More Important Than Ideas","<em><strong>YOU IN 2016: Political Tips You Can Use In Everyday Life : Part Seven </strong></em>

No one appreciates a good idea more than I do. I do run an ad agency, after all—(technically a digital marketing firm). Our business runs on good ideas. But as important as they are, implementing them—executing them—is more important.

It won’t help us to have a great idea for a web video, an email or even a yard sign—if we don’t make it, make it well and have it placed or distributed properly. Execution is key.

The same is true at work and at your church group or neighborhood association. Brainstorming ideas is a great exercise. Someone can stand in front of the room with a marker and an easel with a big pad, furiously writing down the things people in attendance say.

And then…?

Even in a free flowing forum of ideas like a brainstorming session, there has to be structure. There has to be a goal. Not just next steps, but a decision to be made. What’s the idea? What’s the plan? What are we making?

You may be the decision maker. I often am. Make sure someone is. Particularly in big companies, there is the myth of the “good meeting.” But it’s not a good meeting if it doesn’t result in action. And that’s true when you need a fundraising idea for new church furniture, or you’re launching a new product or it’s time to plan the Halloween party at your child’s school.

“It could be this.” “It could be that.” Yes, it could be. But,enough. What WILL it be?

And, above all, execute.","Production Is More Important Than Ideas",2016-10-26,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/production-important-ideas/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/161026_PushInternal_WesBlogImage.jpg,"Production Is More Important Than Ideas",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/161026_PushInternal_WesBlogImage.jpg,,Blog,,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,production-important-ideas,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
682,"Jingle All The Way","<em><strong>My weekly fitness update</strong></em>

For those of you who don’t know, I’m a leader in an all male peer-led workout organization called F3 - Fitness, Fellowship, Faith. During a man’s first workout he gets a nickname chosen by his peers. Mine is Jingles. So for all of you who wonder about the Jingles references here and on my social media, there’s your explanation.

Jingles is back! After being down for a couple weeks and falling off my marathon training schedule, I rebounded last week with a total of 41 miles, two weight-lifting days at the gym and one F3 bootcamp, which I led. That was a total of 10 workouts, which was capped off with a 15.5 mile run on Saturday, my longest in about seven months.

My leg issue continued during the 15-miler, but it wasn’t so bad that I couldn’t hit my goal. The twice-daily foam roller and stretching is helping there. I felt no fatigue or soreness after my run either, although the IT band was acting up on Monday. All in all, I feel much better.

I had to travel a lot this week so I haven’t run in four days. I need to make up the mileage with a couple of long runs this week. I might be signing up for a half marathon on Saturday. The following Saturday is the Savannah Rock and Roll Marathon. I’m currently signed up for the full marathon but will most likely drop back to the half due to the IT band killing my training schedule. The week after that is the Summerville Sweet Tea Half Marathon. That all means I might have three straight weekends of races. Why the hell not? I need more bling.

690,"Believe It Or Not, A Lot Of Political Campaigns Refuse To Pay Their Bills","<strong>Things That Drive Me Batshit Crazy, Part 4</strong>

How’s this for business model? You engage a firm to do work for you—they do it—and then you don’t pay them. Where do you end up—in jail?

No, you end up in the US Senate or the US House of Representatives or the state capital, the mayor’s office, etc.

Political campaigns are NOTORIOUS for not paying their bills. Leaving their vendors (including their digital firms) holding the bag. And, depending on the size of the campaign, that could be a pretty big bag.

And that’s when the candidates win. When they lose, they fold up shop like a pop-up Halloween costume store, never to be seen again. And never to pay.

This would NEVER work in any other industry. NEVER.

Dine and dash? Five-finger discount? Unacceptable.
Not paying me? Perfectly fine, apparently.

This is a massive problem in campaign life. The pace is fast—there’s always next week and the next fundraiser. “Don’t worry—we’ll take care of you.”

The candidates usually have to concentrate on two things: getting votes and getting money. There’s nothing wrong with that. Even if you are running for school board, you will have expenses.

But it’s wrong to not your bills. It just is; whether it’s me, the printer, the landlord or the utility company.

It’s particularly frustrating with conservative candidates who rail against the government racking up debt.

It's completely morally wrong.","Political campaigns that don't pay their bills",2016-10-27,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/things-drive-batshit-crazy-4/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160516_PushDigital_Crazy_FBLink.png,"People Who Say, “I Can’t""",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/160516_PushDigital_Crazy_FBLink.png,,Blog,crazy,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,things-drive-batshit-crazy-4,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
694,"Work On What You Believe In","<em><strong>YOU IN 2016: Political Tips You Can Use In Everyday Life: Part Eight</strong></em>

When you are passionate about something, you can move mountains. Similarly, if there’s something you couldn’t care less about it, your effort will reflect it.

I have been fortunate in my political career personally—and we have been at Push—to work with candidates, issues and corporate clients we believe in 100%.

Okay, that's not entirely true. I went out on my own with one $500 a month client to start Push. I had to take any check I could in the beginning. And honestly, I worked for some candidates I didn't particularly like on the issues, and some I didn't even like as people.

That's not the case now. We have the flexibility to work with folks we believe in.

A good example is Senator Marco Rubio. I worked on his presidential campaign and I'm working for him now on his US Senate race. I talked to other presidential candidates, but my mind always went back to Marco. I agree with him about 98% on the issues (I don't agree with anyone on EVERYTHING) and I believe he's the embodiment of where the Republican Party needs to be to both win elections and, more importantly, to move American toward prosperity.

I'm not just happy to work for Marco. I'm all out friggin pumped. I don't mind the late night emails, early morning calls, the weekend work and all the stress that goes into running campaigns because he gives me energy. He gives me hope for our party and our nation.

I've learned that there’s no substitute for this feeling. You just can’t fake or manufacture enthusiasm.

This should help guide you in your interactions with family, friends, neighbors and at work. If it’s a new project, or you are looking for a volunteer opportunity, or you get appointed to a committee—try your best to find a match with something you are totally into.

What really moves the needle for you? Kids? Animal shelters? The symphony? Parks? Mammograms? Hunger?

There are so many opportunities for fundraising projects, volunteer projects to tackle at and through work, outreach programs from your church, neighborhood clean ups…if you can get involved you won’t miss the meetings, you’ll become an advocate, you’ll feel more fulfilled.

Of course we all need and like money. But that fire in your belly burns for another reason.

Go after that—as much as you can and with all your might.","YOU IN 2016: Political Tips You Can Use In Everyday Life: Part Eight",2016-11-01,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/work-on-what-you-believe-in/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/160921_MarcoRubio_CountOnYou_FBLink.jpg,"Work On What You Believe In",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/160921_MarcoRubio_CountOnYou_FBLink.jpg,,Blog,Politics,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,work-on-what-you-believe-in,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
702,"Winner, Winner; Chicken Dinner","<i>My weekly fitness update</i>

I won something. I’ve never won anything fitness related. Cool, huh?

This past weekend I got seventh place overall and first place in my age group in the Georgetown Bridge to Bridge Half-Marathon. I missed my PR by 40 seconds with a 1:43:10. Man. 40 seconds! Admittedly, it was a pretty small race due to Hurricane Matthew rescheduling. I’m not sure how many folks ran it, but it was more than 500 I think, so seventh is still pretty good. But I don’t want you thinking it was in the thousands.  Still, I got that second medal and it says WINNER, so I’m feeling like a winner this week.

Except for one thing. I have firmly decided that I’m not ready for this weekend’s full marathon in Savannah. Not only did the leg injury halt my training, but it’s actually back this week. It doesn’t hurt as bad as it did, but it’s definitely feeling the effects of the race. So, I’m going to drop to the half- marathon this weekend and then follow it up with the Summerville Sweet Tea Half-Marathon the following weekend. That’s back-to-back-to-back Saturdays with half-marathons. Maybe there's a medal for that!  Should be, right? Then I’ll go for a PR at the Kiawah Marathon in December and then again at the Charleston Marathon in January and then I’m not likely to PR at the hilly Asheville Marathon in March. The weekend after that I will have the Palmetto 200 ultra-relay. YAY! That’s a lot of running.

Okay, so let’s talk about this past weekend’s race. I wore my five finger Vibrams, which typically speeds me up pretty good. However, my feet hurt like hell by mile ten and those last three miles were a real struggle. My leg did start bothering me around mile eight, but I pushed through the pain. I crushed it from an endurance standpoint though. I’m definitely in the best cardio shape I’ve ever been. 

The course included two tall bridges, thus the bridge to bridge theme. We had to go over and back each twice, so that was four pretty large inclines. Those slowed me down a good bit and had it not been for them, I definitely would have PRed. 

This week I’m running about 20 miles before Saturday’s race, lifting twice and Qing one F3 bootcamp. That’s a pretty light week. 

On to Savannah…","I won something. I’ve never won anything fitness related.

The velvet glove? Or the iron fist? The fact is, if you’re in charge, you’ll need both. And you’ll use both, believe me. Political campaigns are high energy, high anxiety, high stakes affairs. They’re not a place for the faint of heart.

Sometimes, you have to drop the hammer. Because people are goofing off. Or because things aren’t getting done. Or because things are getting done, but they’re not getting done well. That’s when it’s time to drop it.

708,"This Has Been One Hell Of A Campaign Season","That’s probably putting it too mildly. But like a lot of people, I ran out of words to describe some of the things that have happened.

What I wanted to talk about, proudly, was this political cycle at Push.

We have been working our asses off for months and months. A lot of late nights. A lot of weekends. And when I say we have not only our largest staff but also our most talented one, I mean it sincerely.

We have done some really great work. Really nice videos, totally cool social posts, super effective fundraising emails. And everything started with solid digital strategies and advertising that was well planned (can’t say enough about how impressive our ad group is—that will take another post in the future).

For starters, we worked on a presidential campaign. While we didn’t make it to the general election, it was a great experience—every primary and every debate. A wild ride.

We have worked on senate campaigns and on behalf of senators who were not up for re-election this year. We were also privileged to assist the National Republican Senatorial Committee in key states.

In the House of Representatives, we have clients who have been in office and others running for the first time. We also worked with some different conservative groups on congressional campaigns in many other states.

We had campaigns for governor in Louisiana and Missouri.

We supported candidates for lieutenant governor, judge, mayor; even school board.

Additionally, we helped some people running for state senate and state house seats.
And we worked on behalf of several ballot issues, and a military base.

Does that sound like a lot?

Did I mention we did that while moving three separate times, surviving floods and a hurricane evacuation? And that we also managed the rest of the Push portfolio of clients with nonpartisan issue advocacy groups and corporate clients?

Did some of our clients lose races? Yes. Did we lose some clients? Yes. Did both hurt me personally? Yes.

But when I have a spare minute to really consider all that we did, and how much the company has grown and grown up, what I mostly feel is pride. I am so proud of this team. And so blessed to be with them.","That’s probably putting it too mildly.

If everyone was a bad sport like you, half the country would be headed north on Wednesday. I have news for you—Canada might not really be overjoyed at that prospect.

Also, don’t you have several houses? Money? Fame? Influence? And that isn’t enough for you?

713,"Rocking and Rolling Through Savannah","I took on a half-marathon for the second straight Saturday. You’ll remember that I was supposed to run the full Savannah Rock and Roll Marathon. I was even telling myself during the first few miles that I was going to run the full marathon, but unfortunately my leg had other plans. I dropped down to the half at the 11 mile split and hobbled across the finish line. Yeah, literally, I hobbled… straight to the medical tent where some awesome massage therapist worked me out real good.

I wasn’t too depressed because going into the event I pretty much knew I was going to drop back. The leg has been giving me fits for weeks now and it was really hurting after the Georgetown half last week. So knowing I would probably drop back, I went out of the gate at half-marathon speed, about a minute faster per mile.

I felt really good, aside from the leg. My cardio is better than its ever been. My energy level is way up, which is probably because I’m taking in a lot more food. Also, I’m nearly 20 pounds heavier than I was during last running season, mostly a result of the heavy weight days at the gym. Speaking of which, I benched 235 for the first time yesterday.

I popped some ibuprofen and pushed through the leg pain, resulting in a PR of 1:41:52 according to my MapMyRun app. The chip time has me at 1:44:03, which is far from a PR. So hell… I don’t know.

Anyway, this Saturday is my third straight race—the Sweet Tea Half- Marathon in my hometown of Summerville.

Remember those carefree days when you were younger and not in charge? Any problems you encountered or heard about were someone else’s to solve. You weren’t responsible.

Not any more! And, with political campaigns, you run into problems you’d never even heard of before. If you’re running the campaign, you’re responsible for problems even if you didn’t create them. Because the buck has to stop somewhere. And, almost without exception, that won’t be anywhere near the candidate.

The press has a problem? You dropped robocalls in the wrong district (yeah, that happened)? You got that certified letter from Paramount's attorney for using an image of ET on a mailer (yeah, that happened too)? Raise your hand. That’s on you.

And, if you’re in charge in any of your circles—neighborhood, work, friends, family, church, whatever—get ready to raise your hand as well.

It won’t do to start pointing fingers. That not what a leader does. If you’re a leader, you have to step up, own up and man up (or woman up). Because the buck stops with you—plain and simple.

Did the Republicans have a flawed candidate? Yes. The Republican candidate for president understood that people are angry. People are upset by the elites, by government, by what they call the mainstream media and by politicians (both parties).

Trump appeared unvarnished and unrehearsed. People often cringed when he spoke, but he wasn’t repeating talking points prepared in D.C. People were SICK of that phoniness. He was authentic.

He spent more time on Twitter (especially) and Facebook. He didn’t spend all of his time with Hollywood celebs or at fancy fundraisers. He held rally after rally after rally all over the country, in big cities and small. He was transparent. What you saw was what you were going to get.

Turns out, he proved almost everyone wrong (including me). He didn’t raise a billion for TV. Didn’t have a large ground game in every county in every state. Didn’t play by the rules.

Didn’t do what the “experts” suggested. Wasn’t conservative enough for the old guard.

And got elected president.

I wouldn’t recommend doing it that way. But I would strongly recommend two things: be authentic and be transparent. Any candidate for any office can do both of those—you don’t need a big budget or a media machine. (We just saw how well that worked.) Be yourself.

The<em> best</em> political campaigns have both—lots of people to do the work, and ample amounts of money. But not every campaign has both. The truth is, most don't. And that's OK with me. Tight budget, not fully staffed--I'm up for the challenge. I'm not a snob who wouldn't touch a smaller-dollar campaign. But there IS one campaign I swore I'd never run.

I promised myself I would never—ever—work on a local campaign where I live. You know all the reasons. “You’ll be too close to it.” “Don’t sh*t where you eat.” “You have to see these people at the grocery store and church.” Etc.

So what did I do? I worked on a local campaign in my hometown.

But there was a reason. I swear. Listen, the people in my community had been complaining like crazy on message boards about a proposal to change from a strong council form of government to a strong mayor form. Not as sexy as working on Marco Rubio stuff, right? It is for me—it’s where I live. It's where I'll raise the boys.

I finally gave in and said, “Guys, you won’t get anywhere by just bitching. You can’t win that way.
You need to get organized, you need a strategy, and you need to get your people together and deploy them.” They asked for help and I jumped in. I helped with the first two. They did the rest.

We didn’t have the budget. But we did have the workers. And, boy, did they work. That was a lot of putting in yard signs and a lot of knocking on doors and a LOT of drama. But you know what else there was?

A victory.

More money would have been helpful. But there’s no way we could have done this without lots of people willing to work hard on it. No way.

793,"Three Halves Equal 1 1/2","<em><strong>My Weekly Fitness Update</strong></em>

I ran a half-marathon for the third straight Saturday. And I crushed it with a PR of 01:41:32. That’s a pace of 07:45. I finished 26th out of 365 and 4th in my age group.

I felt great, too. Maybe it was the yoga, the deep tissue leg massage, the cooler weather, the flat course, the motivation of running with 25 F3 brothers or a combination of everything. I wish every race could be like that.

Now, on to the Kiawah full marathon in less than a month. I’m excited, scared and, frankly, a little tired. But it’s time to pick up the pace (not literally) and put more miles on the road.

There’s not a whole lot more to report this week except that I also started yoga. I’m trying to get in two sessions a week to help with core strengthening and flexibility. The mental calmness sure doesn’t hurt, either. I’ll report back later on how that’s going.

Have a great week. Push Harder!

801,"YOU IN 2016: Political Tips You Can Use In Everyday Life","At the height of the campaign season, I had this idea that many of the things I do naturally—because I’ve been working in politics for 20 years—might help people who don't work in politics (often referred to as “sane people.”) By that, I mean it might help you in your neighborhood, at your church or at work, or when it’s time for PTA meetings.

I don’t know why this occurred to me during the absolute busiest time of year for a political firm, but it did. I really do think many of these tips about motivating volunteers and getting your message out are easy to apply in other situations.

And I am always happy to help. Sometimes one suggestion can make a big difference at the office or at home. I hope you found the tips enjoyable and useful.

We all self promote. Or at least we better. No one else is going to promote us. We have to do it ourselves.

But most companies get into the habit of pumping out content that's nothing more than a beefed up press release. They like to talk about how cool they are and all their big accomplishments.

Let me tell you how many people care about that. Almost none. People want to consume content that helps them. They don't have time to hear about how cool you are. Give them something quick and useful.

That's our content strategy. So we are launching a new web show to answer the question we get more than any others - where should I go in Charleston?

815,"What I'm Thankful For","This post is obviously a few days late. The first thing I’m thankful for is the ability to have taken a few days off. That was nice. And unusual.

It’s been one hell of a year. Some great. Some horrible. That’s just life, especially when you run businesses. But it’s been a good net positive thus far so I’ll take it.

So let’s get into it. This year I’m thankful for…

My wife. She’s put up with far more than any woman should. Every one of my accomplishments, from growing businesses to finishing the GORUCK HTL, are equally hers. But I can’t say her accomplishments are equally mine. Giving me two amazing sons and raising them daily is all her. She’s quite the badass. A smoking hot badass.

My boys. Harlowe is growing like a weed and at 2 1/2 years old can just about hold full on conversations. I don’t want to be one of ""those fathers,"" but the kid is wicked smart and a real sweetheart. As for Tennyson, well, he just kind of lays there all day and occasionally smiles so I can’t vouch for his intelligence or kindness, but he was born healthy and he sleeps well, so that’s all the blessing we need right now. I can’t wait to see his personality arrive.

My team. We’ve been in an endless election cycle for five years. As soon as we came off of the 2014 cycle, Marco’s presidential campaign heated up. Then we immediately went into the 2016 cycle. They hunkered down and built out some of the most creative digital strategies in the business. And they did it without me having to be involved in the details so I could concentrate on strategy and creative. They crushed it. Since I can’t call out all 25, let me at least name the senior team - Michael, Phil, JP, Brooke, Jonathan and The Rock.

My partners. Y’all, Frothy Beard Brewing Company is going to be a big deal. Joey, Steve and Michael are producing amazingly creative beer, the move and expansion is in full swing and the new brewhouse got delivered this morning. We should open in January and start canning just a few months after. And speaking of partners, we haven’t talked a whole lot yet about Zombie Bob’s Pizza, but look for some big things from Ryan in the coming weeks.

My clients. Push’s continued growth wouldn’t be possible without amazing clients. Some political. Some corporate. All awesome! I’m thankful that they’ve put their trust in us and given us a creative outlet for our team to push harder. Oh, and money. Money is nice. You know, it helps make payroll and all.

My health. In 2016 alone I will knock out 2 marathons, a GORUCK HTL, two additional GORUCK Toughs, an ultra-marathon relay and three half- marathons. I started working out because both parents and my step-father passed away at early ages. By now you know that I take things to the extreme, so it shouldn’t be a surprise that I didn’t just stop at going to the gym daily. But knocking out that much in just one year is a huge surprise to me. None of that would have been possible without…

My other boys. The ones I roll with. F3 has completely changed my life and it’s all about the accountability and push the men of F3 Summerville give me every day. They force me out of bed, they make me sign up for stupid events and they push me past limits to places I thought I would never be. They also hold me accountable to being a good man, a spiritual one, and a good father and husband. I’m thankful for all of them, but especially Hotspot (my Normandy brother), Goose and Cousin. Also a big shoutout to Pyle who pushed me in my first marathon and just signed up to pace me at Kiawah.

There’s so much to be thankful for this year and we still have 1/12th of the way to go.

818,"This Brewery Thing Is Actually Happening","<em><strong>A Very Frothy Update</strong></em>

One day while sitting on a beach with some friends, I looked over at Michael Rentiers and said “know what would be cool? Putting our digital agency inside of a brewery.” We where half drunk so it was definitely one of those “yeah, that would be badass” and then you forget about it kind of things.

But it festered. I visited all these cool tech offices like Google, Facebook and Twitter. I kept thinking to myself “yeah, this is badass, but it isn’t a brewery.” I mentioned to my wife that it would be super cool to do one day and she replied “one day? Why wait?” Well, that was a damn good question. Why wait?

Well, the wait is almost over. This thing is happening. Construction is in full swing and this week we crossed another major milestone. The brewing equipment showed up - the brewhouse, bright tank and fermentors. Check out this new video:

823,"Getting My Namaste On","<strong><em>My Weekly Fitness Update</em></strong>

I’m just over a week away from my second marathon. It couldn’t come at a worse time. Damnit, I’m sick again. Yes, AGAIN! It seems like at least once a quarter I go down with a bad cold and chest congestion. I was never like this before. Before what, you ask? Before kids! I’m about two seconds from turning Harlowe into a little hermit so he never gets infested by your kids. AAAGGGGHHHH!!!

Okay, enough whining. This week I’m taking it easy so that I can get all the crud out of my chest. And by taking it easy, I mean I’m not running much and I’m drinking way too much at Christmas parties. 'Tis the season.

On Thanksgiving morning I knocked out 17 miles and felt great. I’ve pretty much taken it easy since then except for a couple lifting days at the gym and a couple yoga sessions. Yes, yoga! I’m finally hitting that goal I’ve had all year and getting in two sessions each week.  I’m loving it so far.

So, why yoga? Two things. First, I’m not very flexible and I have a hard time stretching at home. It’s just like running, rucking, lifting or anything else. If I don’t have the accountability, I don’t do it. Yoga gives me that accountability to stretch and concentrate on core strength. I believe it’s going to ease some of the injuries I have been having recently, such as the IT band issue. Secondly, as you know by now, I strongly believe in mental training. Learning to breathe and concentrate are core ingredients for endurance challenges. I’m hoping yoga is an additional step in getting my mind right for some upcoming events.

Tomorrow I’ll lift, do yoga and go for a five mile run. Saturday I’ll go for a twenty miler. Then next week it’s a couple short runs, two yoga sessions, three lifting days and no bootcamps or rucks in order to taper a bit and prevent any injuries. All in all I’m feeling pretty good, except for all the green crud I’m hacking up.

Namaste, yo! Keep pushing.

826,"Why A Digital Agency And A Brewery In One?","I love drinking. In college I got tired of drinking the same fizzy yellow crap every night so I wondered into the craft beer space and fell in love. I can drink a different kind of beer every night. Craft brewers are the same exact creature as us marketers. They're creatives.  I discovered that I love craft beer for the same reason I love my marketing agency.

It's that love of creativity that binds us together. We're rule breakers. We don't believe in doing things the same way they've always been done.

831,"People Who Say, “I Can’t""","<em><strong>THINGS THAT DRIVE ME BATSH*T CRAZY #6</strong></em>

One of the most powerful phrases you can say or hear is “I can.” I suppose I have always been determined or stubborn about things. That has served me well even in jobs I had as a teenager. I was quick to raise my hand to volunteer and I was not intimidated by anything or anyone (at least not outwardly!).

As an adult, I have tested my limits to get in and to stay in better shape. And, I did it for the challenge as well. Thanks to F3 and GoRuck I have done TONS of things I never thought I would do. Taking part in a 200-mile tag team ultra-marathon? Carrying all kinds of heavy sh*t all over hell’s half-acre? Back-to-back-to-back half-marathons? Completing a GRUELING HTL in Normandy???

This weekend during the Kiawah Marathon both legs and arms locked up around mile 21. It was strangest thing I've ever felt. I literally could not control my limbs as if they had been detached. I fell to the ground. I told my buddy ""I can't."" I have rarely been so ashamed of myself. I immediately felt that shame and said out loud, ""what the f*ck did you just say? (excuse my language but that's what I said). I got up. I walked. I limped. I ran- limped. Then I ran.

I can. In fact, I did. Maybe that’s why I have so little tolerance for people who say, “I can’t.” I’m not talking about legal or moral issues here—I’m talking about pushing yourself. Running longer or faster. Lifting more weights. Climbing a higher mountain, literally or figuratively.

The same is true with non-physical tasks. At work. At home. With friends. There can always be a reason to NOT do something. People will say, “I can’t” to just about anything, for just about any reason. Too busy. Too tired. Too expensive. Too complicated.

Bullsh*t. I’m the least athletic person I know, and I did it. And I didn’t leverage my parents’ friends at the country club to help me start my business. Instead, on both fronts, I busted my ass. That’s how I got in shape. And started a business.

You can’t quit smoking? You can’t spend more time with your kids? Sure you can.

840,"Humblebrag: I’m A Two-Time Marathoner","The cramp might slow me, but it won't stop me

Well, I did it. I crossed my second marathon finish line this past Saturday. It wasn’t pretty at all, but I beat my goal by eight minutes; finishing in 3:52:06. That’s 20 minutes faster than my first marathon, the Charleston Marathon, this past January. 

I’m happy with my performance, but I’m also disappointed because I could have, I should have, finished much sooner. Honestly, at this point, I’m not sure I will ever be completely satisfied with my performance in any event. I always want to do better. But this time is different because I WAS doing better. So here’s the deal…

F3 Summerville’s Pyle was kind enough to sign up late for this race, having not trained for it, to pace me. The dude is a beast. We were flying at a sub 8 pace for the first 10 miles. Then we started backing off to about an 8:15 - 8:30 pace. Around mile 19 I started hurting pretty good. My endurance was high but my legs started cramping up slightly. Knowing I had a good bit of time and I was on pace for a 3:40 - 3:45 finished, we backed off to a 9- minute pace. 

Then around mile 21, disaster struck. Both legs AND both arms totally cramped up. It was like nothing I had ever felt before. I literally could not control them. They hurt like hell, so I knew they were there, but it was like they detached. I hit the ground hard.

Ryan ran over and forced me up, telling me that moving would make it better. Another F3 guy ran by and threw a pack of salt tablets at me. I took a few and just started walking. Then I was limp-running, basically a hobble. Eventually I could run a few minutes at a time, backing off occasionally to a brisk walk. But by now I had dropped to an 11-minute pace.

A few times I felt a surge of energy and was able to maintain an 8:30 pace for a couple of minutes, but the cramping kept coming back. I saw a few F3 guys on the side of the road including TNT and Stagecoach. Their cheers gave me energy to run, but the running never lasted more than five minutes before I had to back off. 

Those last five miles hurt like a son of a bitch, but thankfully I had Pyle by my side to push me through. Thank God for our F3 brotherhood. 

So, I crushed my PR and my goal. But I didn’t finish where I could have. 

I trained hard.
I drank a lot of water.
I ate before the race and along the way. 

However, I didn’t take any salt or additional electrolytes. I’ll be playing with those over the next four weeks as I prepare to take my revenge on the Charleston marathon in pursuit of a 3:45!

This week my routine is: two bootcamps w/ ruck, three days lifting, two yoga and a 5k. Next week I’ll do all that minus the 5k, with two five-milers and a 15-miler. 

BOOM! On to Charleston…

844,"The Digital Political Landscape in Sixty Seconds*","How digital agencies like mine fit into politics has been changing rapidly ever since we opened our doors. Competitors and clients alike have ranged from skeptical to amazed.

The current trend has two conflicting parts. One, that media consumption is more and more niche messages to niche audiences. That’s a plus for a digital agency. Two, that traditional TV agencies are grabbing more of the budgets meant for digital. And how do they spend it? By putting TV spots online. Square peg, round hole.

So where does that leave us? We’re becoming silent ATMs churning out fundraising emails (which we do and do well—don’t get me wrong).

Of course when the TV agencies see larger and larger parts of “their” budgets going to digital they would try to do something about it.

Yes, they’re drinking my milkshake. Or trying to. And it doesn’t make sense. Because trend #1 isn’t stopping—content will keep being more and more niche to audiences that are also—-closer and closer to 1:1.

Advantage: digital. (Say it like the court announcer says at Wimbledon.)

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I also don’t like how the wise men giving gifts to our Savior and Saint Nicholas giving gifts to little poor children, has all been commercialized by major corporations with the main intent to sell shit. That drives me absolutely crazy.</span></p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Gifts should be given when someone truly deserves it or you want to surprise someone that you love. </span></p>

859,"Programming Note: It’s Vision Time","<p style=""text-align: left;"">One of my top goals for 2016 was to relaunch my personal blog after a couple years off and blog every weekday. I can’t say that I’ve blogged every single weekday, but I can say that I’ve crushed my blog and pumped out a lot of content. Some of it is really really good. In fact, later next week I’ll post a round-up of my favorite posts.</p>
For now, I just wanted to let you know that I’m going to chill on the blog for the next seven to ten days. I’ll post a couple things, like the before mentioned round-up, but I’m going to take the next week to stay off the computer and concentrate on my goals for 2017. You know, those things I’ve blogged about repeatedly over the last year.

So, I’m stepping into my cave to write Vision 2017.

This is the first time I've been interviewed for a podcast and it's also the first time I've opened up about my childhood beyond my own blog. I'm honestly pretty nervous to share this with you.

This is full of really good marketing and personal advice. Listen to the whole thing if you want to hear about goal setting, which is super important as we head into 2017.  Listen from 26 minutes on if you want to hear my personal story.

Sorry that my Wi-Fi connection sucked and my Skype was choppy.

901,"How You Can Actually Lose Weight in 2017","Yesterday the Push team arrived back in the office for the first time in 2017. During our weekly staff meeting I asked each of my teammates to give me two things:

1. One of your personal resolutions.

2. One of your professional resolutions to improve yourself, your
department and the company.

Like many Americans, I continuously heard “lose weight” as a personal resolution. Or as Phil Vangelakos said, “not have my gut jiggle when I brush my teeth.”

No surprise there, as you’re probably seeing lines for the treadmills at the gym right now. Give it two months. You’ll see three of eight treadmills completely open at all times.

I’m not going to give you some “Lose 30 pounds in 30 days” quick solutions. Those almost always (and inevitably) fail. You might lose those pounds, but your tendency to want quick solutions means you gain them back with a few
more. Instead, I’m going to give you a formula to lose weight and to actually keep it off. It’s not quick. It sucks. Embrace the suck and stop looking for quick solutions. Push harder and get real results. Get better. Be better.
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Use this formula to lose pounds, build muscle, train for a 10k or to start and grow your own business. It’s not about losing weight. It’s about setting and meeting goals.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Here’s the formula:</strong></p>

<h3><strong>1. Set numerical goals:</strong></h3>
Don’t have these vague ideas like “lose weight” or “make more money.” Give them real numerical values that you can actually meet. And actually measure:
<ul>
 	<li>Drop 15 pounds</li>
 	<li>Earn a 20% bonus</li>
 	<li>Read ten books</li>
</ul>
Having a number in mind makes it easier to remember and gives you an actual goal to shoot for. You will either hit that goal or you won’t, but at least you have something to chase. Keep it clear and focused. As you should be.
<h3><strong>2. Break those goals down into smaller obtainable goals</strong></h3>
You know the joke about how to eat an elephant? One bite at a time. Don't call PETA on me. It's just another way of saying ""one step at a time."" You should have a:
<ul>
 	<li>Yearly goal</li>
 	<li>Quarterly goal</li>
 	<li>Monthly goal</li>
 	<li>Weekly goal</li>
 	<li>Daily goal</li>
</ul>
Training to run your first marathon or slimming down to fit back into your old jeans takes effort--and time. You will feel better if you can achieve these milestone goals. Not if; when you achieve them.

And then...
<h3><strong>3. Daily ""to-do"" items that add up to those goals:</strong></h3>
Every day has to figure into the big goals. Now, for some things like marathon training, you need to have days off (of running) scheduled. But for most of these goals, it's repetitive tasks every day that become good habits, or a slowly escalating scale. You need a ""to-do"" list. Something like:
<ul>
 	<li>Run five miles today</li>
 	<li>Lift for 45 minutes today</li>
 	<li>Yoga today</li>
</ul>
The plan may differ (based on the goal), but it has to actually be a to-do item every day<span class=""s1"">— </span>and a commitment to scratch the to-do's off your list.
<h3><strong>4. Track everything:</strong></h3>
You can’t figure out what you’re doing right and what you’re doing wrong unless you can analyze your actions. And the only way to do either is by tracking your progress. This is getting ridiculously easy with technology like Fitbit, sites like Goodreads and software at work<span class=""s1"">—</span>or you can use an old dependable method like mine:

<img class=""size-full wp-image-903 aligncenter"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wesley-Weight-Loss-Blog.jpg"" alt="""" width=""100%"" />

The important thing is not how you track, but that you do. You do get a good feeling checking the box or entering the number on a regular basis. It's true.
<h3><strong>5. Build an accountability team</strong></h3>
No matter how big or small your goal is, you will be tempted to sleep through your alarm, convince yourself the weather is too crappy, or not feel like following up on business leads. Here's what you need:

People you can count on to bug the living shit out of you.

You might be able to enlist your spouse or a friend or a co-worker--for me,
it's my F3 brothers and they shame me on social media and everywhere else.
Just do what works for you. But you will need something or someone. No one
can do it alone.
<h3><strong>6. Find an event </strong></h3>
Everyone works better with a deadline. And whether it's a number on a scale or a mountain to scale, having the destination on the horizon is a good thing.

Especially if it's an event--your high school reunion, the Thanksgiving turkey trot run, the beginning of swimsuit season--the date circled on the calendar is a great motivator. It's also a light at the end of the tunnel.

There you go. Your path to fitness, weight loss, business gain, knowledge... you're welcome! Follow the plan. Get off your ass.

<strong>And have a great 2017.</strong>","A simple formula to get shit done",2017-01-05,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/actually-lose-weight-2017/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wesley-Weight-Loss-Blog.jpg,"How You Can Actually Lose Weight in 2017",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wesley-Weight-Loss-Blog.jpg,,Blog|Fitness,Fitness|weightloss,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,actually-lose-weight-2017,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
913,"I've Been Humbled by Water","I’m not saying I’m Superman. I’m not cut. I’m not the strongest or the fastest guy around. But I am in the best shape of my life. My endurance is high. I’m lifting more than I’ve ever lifted. I’m decently fast. But man, after my first swim workout, I felt like a little pansy.

I have decided that my big 2018 goal will be a full Ironman triathlon. That’s a 2.4 mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride and a full 26.2 mile marathon run. That’s insanity, given that I don’t bike and I have no idea how to really swim. I must start somewhere, so I’m going to do a Half Ironman this October with the Charleston Sprint Series, five small triathlon events, in the months leading up to the Ironman. That means I have to start swimming and biking right now.

I started swimming on Friday with F3 Summerville’s swim group, Tsunami. For 45 minutes I tried my best to swim laps back and forth as F3 brother and swimming expert, Speedo, tried teaching me proper technique. Let’s just say that it did not go well and I swallowed enough chlorine for my food, coffee and beer to taste chlorinated for the rest of the day.

Swim training continues this week as I lay off the running a bit, tapering for this weekend’s Charleston Marathon. Yep, another full marathon as I take revenge on that son of a bitch course that kicked my ass last year.

I’m also back in full GORUCK training mode. I have a double Light event and then the Fort Bragg Heavy in February. All that is hard core training for what will be the toughest event of my life, an F3 Custom Heavy Heavy, in April.

I’m feeling good. My back is feeling a lot better. I have energy. I got my mind right. I do have a little cold but, hell, it’s never going to be perfect and that’s expected with these 50-degree temperature swings.

Keep me in your prayers on Saturday. Marathons suck and this one is sure to really suck. It’s time to embrace the suck again.

Push Harder!

917,"New Year, Big Push","I take the last couple of weeks of every year to really focus on goals for the new year. Recently, I have taken a lot of time to focus on the direction I want to go in 2017 for myself and for Push.

I am a very goal-oriented person; always have been. That’s just how my brain operates. I set goals for myself and I work every single day to get closer to accomplishing those goals.

That's what I'm working on right now at Push. If we don't pause now, we're never going to. We’ll get too busy. Now is the time to make things happen. Now is the time to make some changes.

I promise you this: 2017 is going to be a fantastic year for Push and our clients. No question about it.

932,"Why Term Limits Are Good For America","I think term limits would be the best thing for my business because that would mean more campaigns! Honestly, I think term limits is the best idea for our country, so that no one leader gains too much power.

Often, those who claim to support term limits find themselves greedy with power shortly after they get to office. They become power-hungry, and they try to stay in their positions longer and longer to fuel that hunger. It’s a vicious cycle.

Our country deserves fresh ideas, otherwise we will have the same people standing for the same values and no progress will be possible.

I absolutely support term limits.

946,"Have a Reason to Run for Office","What’s the first step to running for office? Having a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">reason</span> to run.

The majority of the time, people don’t have a good reason. Limelight, power and/or a play in the game are not solid reasons when it comes to running for public office. What you really need is <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">passion</span>.

I got into politics because I grew up as the “poor kid.” Both of my parents had severe drug addictions, causing my father to be imprisoned, while my mother died of an overdose.

My childhood led me to believe that the system was broken, and I wanted to get involved in politics to make a difference.

I personally never felt called to run for office. Instead, I thought that I could have the greatest impact being the man behind the scenes, helping hundreds of awesome people get into office to serve. This way, rather than only one individual serving, hundreds of others could make their mark in office.

I cannot stress enough the importance of having a reason to run. Without it, you are wasting your time and that of others.

967,"Seeking Advice On Upcoming Fitness Events","My weekly fitness updates haven’t been so weekly lately. I know you all miss me talking about myself, right? You wake up every morning yearning for my fitness update post so you know exactly how my body feels. It’s okay to admit it. You’re weird like that.

If you’re not my wife or one of my F3 brothers, you probably don’t give two shits about these posts. But maybe you should. You can learn something from me and if you respond, I can learn something from you. That’s what I need right now. I need to learn from you because I’m having a real hard time putting together my workout routine.

Here’s why:

2/4 - Folly Beach Half Marathon
2/11 - GORUCK Double Light
2/17 - GORUCK Heavy
2/26 - GORUCK Gun Course (not a fitness event)
3/12 - Asheville Marathon
3/24 - Palmetto 200 Ultra team
4/6 - GORUCK Heavy Heavy
5/21 - Triathlon Sprint 1 of 5

I have long runs including a marathon and an ultra marathon relay. That requires a lot of running. I have GORUCK events, including a Heavy and a Heavy Heavy, both of which will be grueling and require a lot of ruck time and lifting. Then I start my triathlons and currently I have ZERO swim experience and I don’t even own a bike yet.

So, right now I need to be:

1. Running
2. Rucking
3. Lifting
4. Biking
5. Swimming
6. Yoga (helps prevent injury)

I’m easing up on the running because I feel pretty good. Right now it’s just about maintenance and not losing ground. I have to get more time under the ruck and I must continue lifting. Pretty much NOW I must start swimming three times a week.

Guys, I just don’t know how to fit it all in. I’m mentally prepared. I’ll work out three times a day. I don’t give a shit. I just can’t find the time. And honestly, I’m stressed as hell about it.

If you have any advice you’re willing to give on how I should balance all this, please let me know. Your advice is appreciated.

Have a phenomenal week!

990,"Pay to Play Awards","“I’d like to thank my beautiful wife, my great kids, my Uncle Vic, my dog, my…” Wait. No. I’m not giving an acceptance speech for an industry award. How did we get to this point, anyway?

Here’s what I think happened: everyone who isn’t a professional athlete or a Hollywood movie star felt unappreciated and unrecognized, so an industry organization (or a fast-buck artist) set up an awards show. In some industries, LOTS of awards shows.

The advertising business is especially guilty in this regard (big show in Cannes, just like Hollywood has)—and political advertising is not far behind. I don’t get it. We need a big credenza in the lobby for trophies? Everyone is that desperate to have “award-winning” appear before his or her name?

Here’s what’s worse: I think the industry recognition shows routinely recognize companies and individuals for their accomplishment of paying entry fees. That's right. Because if you don't pay the entry fee, you don't win.
Many of these ""awards shows"" are not out to recognize the best work--they're just cash registers. It's pay to play.

No thanks.

This isn’t sour grapes on my part. And maybe if I were just starting out, it would make a difference to me if I won something. Know what makes a difference to me now? Winning elections. Winning more market share for clients. Winning people over to an advocacy groups’s position.

And I’d like to thank our clients and staff for making all of that ^ possible.

998,"The Only Thing That Matters","<strong>My thoughts on Friday night around 0200</strong>

There's only one thing that matters right now.

It's not a dropped ball by a subcontractor, vendor or utility company. Its not the opening deadline of our brewery. It's not a client screwing me over. It's not the internal politics of politics or corporations. It's not the massive debt racked up by a client. It's not the personal problems of one staffer or the whining of another. It's not the pressure of making payroll this month.

It’s not another family death. It's not a crying kid or finding time for Elizabeth. It's not all the things that have my mouth full of stress ulcers or what has me puking after morning workouts.

It's not the excruciating pain shooting through my crushed back, shoulders, calves and feet. It's not how many hours we've gone or will go. It's not the miles in front of me.

Only one thing in the entire world matters at this moment. Getting this damn 200 pound steel manhole cover to that railroad track.

That's it. Don't drop it. Don't stop walking.

Find joy in the pain. The obstacle is the way. Embrace this suck. Push harder. Stop being a little bitch right now. You’re reborn hard.

Sing something. Caroline, heartbroken hard times never got us down. Walking the same line through every shady southern town. Hand in hand your arm 'round mine. Caroline, you do just fine.

That's working. Keep singing. Shit, that hurts. I hope the guys behind me don't drop this thing. That's an immediate broken ankle. Keep singing. AAAAAAGGGGHHHH!

You did it. We’re here. The railroad track. Now take another step. Get to that street light. It’s the only thing that matters.

1039,"Why All This Insanity?","<strong>And Why Blog About It?</strong>

I’m a total wuss. I’m soft as cotton. I don’t do manly things. I don’t like getting dirty. I don’t hunt and fish. I don’t do things with my hands like fix things and build things.

My parents divorced when I was seven years old, when I should have been learning how to become a man. We visited my father on and off for a few years and then he totally disappeared. Instead of having a man teach me things, I grew up with a mom and a sister. To make ends meet and to get us off of government assisted living (we lived in section 8 housing and ate with food stamps), my mother went to cosmetology school and became a hair dresser. I was one of her guinea pigs. She literally practiced perms on my head. So yeah, when I should have been learning how to kill things and use tools, I was getting my hair permed.

My mother eventually remarried but my stepfather and I didn’t get along well. He was a man’s man and by then I was more interested in going to Star Trek conventions. I didn’t appreciate his blue collar ways at all. In hindsight, I realize he could have been the biggest asset in my life and I was just a little friggin' punk. He later died of a brain tumor.

Now I have two boys and it’s my turn to teach them how to be men in a nation I fundamentally believe is going soft. The art of manhood is dying. Strength is no longer seen as an asset. In fact, strength is even vilified by many while men becoming women is acceptable. Being a man isn’t as important as it once was, despite the fact that manhood and strength are the foundations of this nation. We didn’t become the best country in the world by being soft. We fought and worked our way here. We got dirty. We got hurt. We became badass.

The only way to teach my boys how to be men is to become a man. I’ve spent the better part of the last three years doing just that. I had the foundation. I’m one of the most mentally tough dudes you’ll meet. That happens when you watch your mother get beat to a pulp, scratch and claw your way through welfare and build a career and businesses with absolutely nothing ever handed to you.

I just didn’t realize until I started this journey that my brain is calloused. Just as your hands can be calloused through hard work and pain, the brain can become calloused too. I was ready. I just had to become comfortable with being physically uncomfortable.

A few weeks ago at a Bible study my friend Cannoli (his F3 name) asked me “why do you keep doing all this? Where’s it coming from? What’s the motivation?” Here’s the answer<span class=""s1"">—</span>I’m putting myself through as much training as I can, as much pain as I can, across as many finish lines as I can to harden my body, my soul and my spirit. I will become a man to teach my boys that manhood and strength are not just assets, but necessary traits to succeed, to protect our community and to build our nation. I won’t just tell them. I’ll show them what they can do.

I’m no longer the wuss that I was just a few years ago. I still can’t build or fix things. I’ve stabbed a few hogs in the heart, endured a lot of pain through GORUCK events and next weekend I’ll cross my fourth marathon finish line. I’m not where I want to be yet, but at least I’ve done some things to set a good example for my boys.

Thank you for following me on my journey. I hope my blogging eventually motivates you to step out of your comfort zone and to change the things you don’t like about yourself too.","And Why Blog About It?",2017-03-01,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/why-all-this-insanity/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/170301_Push_Wesley_FBLink.jpg,"Why All This Insanity?",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/170301_Push_Wesley_FBLink.jpg,,Blog|Fitness,GOruck|manhood|mentality,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,why-all-this-insanity,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
1047,"Jesus Spent 40 Days Embracing the Suck","<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The following was written for my F3 brothers on <a href=""http://f3nation.com/""><span class=""s2"">f3nation.com</span></a>. I thought you may find something useful too.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We’re currently in the Lenten Season, 40 days leading up to Easter Sunday, commemorating the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert while being tempted by Satan. Here’s the full story as told in the Book of Luke:</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 2 where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry. </i></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>3 The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.” 4 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone.’”</i></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>5 The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. 6 And he said to him, “I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to. 7 If you worship me, it will all be yours.”8 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.’”</i></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>9 The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down from here. 10 For it is written:</i></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>“‘He will command his angels concerning you</i></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>    to guard you carefully;</i></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>11 they will lift you up in their hands,</i></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>    so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’[d]”</i></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>12 Jesus answered, “It is said: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’” 13 When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time.</i></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">“What are you giving up for Lent?” is a question you hear from Christians and non-Christians alike, many not knowing the story as to why they are giving something up at all. During the devotional period of my last three F3 Qs, I encouraged my brothers to not only give something up, but to actually take something.  </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Read this story every day, find a trait in Jesus that you can take, and use it in your daily life. Many say that we should be like Jesus. Well, that’s a pretty tall order. We can’t possibly be like the man who knew no sin. We can’t die for the sins of all men. We can’t be born of a virgin. We can’t perform miracles, heal diseases, resurrect the dead. But we can find some traits in Jesus that we can replicate. This story gives us a few, but here are three I find useful for our F3 brothers:</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>1. Fight temptation. </b></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Jesus had the devil in his ear while he was starving in a hot desert. He offered Jesus a way out. He even offered Jesus the world, literally. But Jesus had his eye on the bigger prize and did not waver. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Temptation is the downfall of too many men. It can be the temptation of money, one more drink, chasing skirt or even the temptation to stay in bed. If Jesus can fight temptation as big as control of the entire world while undergoing intense physical struggle, you can fight the temptation of just about anything. You can’t die for man’s sins, but you can fight the temptation to stay in bed and not work out.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>2. Don’t Friggin Quit. </b></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is the ultimate DFQ story in the Bible. Sure, he embraced the suck as much as a human can embrace the suck during his torture and crucifixion, but at that point, he was in it. There was no getting out. Here he had an out. He didn’t have to keep enduring physical hardship. He could have bowed out after a few hours and even taken control of the world while doing it. But he sucked it up with a hardcore DFQ attitude.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Many of us workout every day, run marathons or take on many other crazy events like GORUCK. We have brothers beside us who tell us we can do one more rep, run one more mile and get that log over our head. Not only did Jesus not have that but he had the devil in his ear telling him to quit. Could you imagine doing all the crazy stuff we do with someone telling us to just quit? We’d probably drop it all and immediately walk away.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Not Jesus. He kept going. 40 days and 40 nights. No food. The heat. And the Devil telling him to stop. Jesus is telling you DFQ!</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>3. Strengthen the soul by strengthening the body.</b></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I’ll keep repeating this — 40 days and 40 nights. No food. The heat. And the Devil telling him to stop.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Many of us think we’re so hardcore because we run marathons or ultra-marathons. Some of us do 24 hour or 50 hour GORUCK events. Y’all… consider yourself hardcore when you can take on 40 days and 40 nights in a desert with the Devil. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We do all this to strengthen our bodies, but how many of us do it for something deeper? Do you workout and take on events to strengthen your mind, spirit and soul?  If not, you should.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Here Jesus teaches us that in order to strengthen our souls and to truly get closer to God, we need to endure physical hardship. We must go beyond getting comfortable to being uncomfortable and feeling actual pain. We have to push ourselves to the extreme limits and beat away all the BS until we reach our cores, until we are stripped naked of the weaknesses the modern world has created.

1051,"This is One of My Worst Habits","<strong>Going until my body collapses</strong>

I have a bad habit.

I go hard. Real hard. Until I can’t go anymore. Then I’m down for days at a time.

That’s where I am this week. I should be celebrating the grand opening of Frothy and drinking my face off. Instead, I’m coughing up a lung, feeling like ass and staying in bed.

I started falling ill last week and instead of taking time off, I ran a marathon. Yeah, I literally had a fever and ran a full marathon, in the snow. That wasn’t the plan. It was going to be Elizabeth’s first marathon and I told myself weeks in advance that this one wasn’t about me. It was about my lady. I was going to run with her and not worry about my pace. The only goal was to finish and get her across the finish line.

<img class=""size-full wp-image-1054 aligncenter"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Pic-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""2448"" height=""3264"" />

I felt horrible Friday and Saturday and then woke up Sunday in Asheville feeling like crap. I told myself that I would run to the first aid stage, three miles in, and get a ride back. I just wanted to get her started and motivated. I got to mile three and thought “I’ll go to the next station.” Then I was at mile eight and said “I’ll just dip out at the split for the half marathon and get the half medal.” Then I got to the half split and thought “well shit, I’m half way now. Might as well keep going.”

<img class=""size-full wp-image-1055 aligncenter"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Pic-3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""3024"" height=""4032"" />

After two stops at medical tents for a total of about 30 minutes, getting confused to the point where I couldn’t do simple math, stumbling off the course multiple times and eventually falling and then doing some horrible walk, run, shuffle for miles, I crossed the finish line way behind Elizabeth… a FULL HOUR slower than my marathon PR.

This isn’t new. I keep doing this. I go go go until my body collapses. It’s ignorant to the point where one day I might seriously hurt myself or cause permanent damage. I acknowledge my issue and I’ll fix it.

Last week I didn’t blog much because we were trying to get Frothy open. This week I’m not blogging much because I feel like crap. I’ll get back on it ASAP.

Thanks for reading. Thanks for caring.

I got the flu and ignorantly ran the Asheville Marathon anyway. My body fell apart, but I finished.

1065,"This is the One Word I Hate Above All Others","<strong>Rest.</strong>

I hate rest. I don’t do it well at all. I move. All the time. It’s what I do.

But now it’s time. Not because I want to. But because I have to. My body is demanding it.

About two years ago I decided to fill my calendar with endurance events and to cover my wall with bling<span class=""s1"">—</span>patches and medals. I thought that by always having an event I would force myself to work harder and harder. It has worked in my professional life, so it must work for physical improvement too, right?

Not so much. This journey has been a real learning experience. I’ve learned that I’m not the fastest or the strongest, but I am able to endure more pain than most people. I’ve learned that I am headstrong and capable of so much more than I thought. I’ve learned that few tasks in this world are really impossible.

However, I’ve also learned that the human body can’t keep going that hard without some rest. The cardiovascular system, immune system and muscles must rebound after extreme duress. I have failed to give them adequate rest.

I went hard, real hard, in the fall and winter. In the past four months alone I’ve completed three marathons, a GORUCK Heavy and an ultra-marathon relay. Because of all that stress, my immune system has hit rock bottom and I’ve been sick for over a month. So now I must finally accept the word I hate the most and rest. That means no big endurance events for two<span class=""s1"">—</span>three months. I’ll still train, but nothing huge.

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">After being sick for nearly a month, going into my third Palmetto 200, I knew I wasn’t 100%.  I started off rocky and finished strong. Still, I was the weak link on my six-man team and I’m determined to never let that happen again. I can’t say I’m totally disappointed in my performance given how sick I’ve been, but I am pretty sad that I let my team down. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you’ve been reading my fitness updates and AARs, you know that this event caps off a few months of intense events.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>October:</b> Georgetown Half-Marathon</span></p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>March:</b> Asheville Marathon, Palmetto 200</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">All that on top of a ton of Push work, opening a brewery and, oh, Elizabeth having Tennyson. It’s been absolute chaos, but I’ve managed to knock out a lot of awesome goals and now I’m taking a break from events to concentrate on training for my next goals (more on that later). I wish I could have capped off my string of events with a badass performance, but that just didn’t happen. I survived, so I’ll take it. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This is my favorite event of the year. I love being in the van with my teammates, talking trash, pulling each other through dark times and celebrating the good results. This year was no different. My team was truly badass. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1077 aligncenter"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Palmetto2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1200"" height=""628"" /></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Training:</b> Nothing new here. I continued my normal routine of running three times a week (including one long run on the weekend), lifting, bootcamps and some yoga. My goal has been to always be ready to run a marathon.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>My team: </b>Stick Em, Old Flame, Pyle, Johnny 5, Floppy and Jingles (that’s me). Also major props to our badass driver, High Stick.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Palmetto 200:</b> A 205-mile relay race from Columbia, SC to Charleston, SC.  Most teams are 12-man. We were on a <b>six-man</b> ultra marathon team, meaning we ran double the legs and double the miles. Do the math. That’s </span><span class=""s2"">double</span><span class=""s1""> badass. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>My legs:</b> 2, 6, 14, 20, 26, 32</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I was the second of six runners. You’ll probably notice that my legs are off and I had leg six when I should have had leg eight. That’s because I had to ditch my teammates, get picked up and taken to Charleston for a meeting with the CEO of our largest client and then get taken back to the course. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Yes, you read that right. Somehow we pulled it off. That should be a blog all by itself. Remind me. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Leg 2:</b> This was my third P200 and, in three races, this was my <i>hardest</i> leg. It was a 10.51-mile hilly hot mess and one of only a couple listed as very hard. I'll venture to say that out of 36 legs, this was the hardest. I went out strong but the heat hit me hard by mile two. Then came the hills.  I was hoping for an 8-minute pace but was forced to slow down to 9 minutes because the congestion weighed heavy on my lungs. This leg also screwed me up mentally. Starting off bad never helps.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I cheated. I did. I admit it. I got a ride in a pickup truck for about .05 mile. A large and angry dog came after me. I yelled at it. I ran away from it. I even ran at it. The bastard kept coming. I flagged down a young redneck boy in a rusted pickup truck. He must have thought I was about to shoot him. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Him: “What's wrong?"" </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Me: ""This damn dog is coming after me.""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Him: ”Oh shit. Get in.""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Me: ”Thanks, man. Can you just drive me around that curb?""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Him. ”Yeah. What are you doing out there?""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Me: ”I’m running a relay from Columbia to Charleston.""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Him: ”Damn dude, are you sure you don't want me to take you further?""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I later learned that Speedo, who was on the other Summerville ultra team and who was about five minutes ahead of me, kicked that dog in the face. Maybe that’s why he was so damn pissed.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Leg 6: </b>Things didn't get much better on my second leg, a 6.25-miler. Lots of hills. Even hotter temperature. And I got chicked. Chicked! I never get chicked. This chick was straight flying.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">(Chicked: to be passed by a female)</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I ran at about an 8:45 pace, well below my normal pace for this distance.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Leg 14:</b> My worst leg of the event. You would think the break, the trip to Charleston, a strong lunch, seeing my family and a hot shower would have brought me back strong. It didn't. If anything, it made it worse.  </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I left the transition zone feeling great. I was back to old Jingles; the guy<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>who can knock out 5.33-milers with a sub-7:30 pace. And I was. Despite the heat, I was flying through Santee. I crossed over I-95 with my legs loose, my lungs finally feeling free and my head up high. Just one problem...</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Steven: ”Hey Wesley, are you lost?""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I look over to see Steven Parish, who I knew from my previous church in Columbia, in a van with his teammates.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Me: ”No, I'm great.”</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Steven: ”No man, you missed the turn a couple miles back.""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I hopped into the van and they took me back to the turn. My brain went to shit. I started thinking about the heat and my congestion. I started walking. I was feeling sorry for myself for the extra miles and the time I cost my team. Even without the 20ish minutes lost, I ran at a 9:02 pace. Pitiful. Straight-up pitiful.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Leg 20:</b> Things started improving on my fourth leg. It was nearing midnight and the temperature was a little warm, but the sun wasn’t beating down.  It was 9.75 in the pitch black dark running along side the swamps of Santee. I could see about four feet in front of me thanks to my headlamp, but that was about it. Occasionally the blue lights of the police officers keeping the route safe would speed by. I didn’t see another soul the entire leg. I zoned out by listening to Bon Iver’s “Holocene” for nearly ten straight miles. I kept my head down and began feeling like the old Jingles again. I finished with an 8:15 pace.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Leg 26:</b> My fifth leg was awesome. 3.76 miles in the pitch black night around 3:30 am along the rural streets of Huger, SC. I stopped for 10 seconds to take a picture showing we were closing in on Charleston. Aside from that, I ran my butt off and finished with a 7:50 pace.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><img class=""size-full wp-image-1076 aligncenter"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Palmetto1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1200"" height=""628"" /></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Leg 32:</b> The sun rose on what seemed like a short night. We were the third team through every checkpoint since we last saw the sun, which means we didn’t see another runner all night. My last run was just 2.95 miles across Sullivan’s Island. Knowing I didn’t have to save anything in the tank, I decided to go out and absolutely crush it. I did, with a pace of 7:32. Pyle wasn’t even ready for the handoff. He was still in the van. It felt good to have my mojo back. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Nutrition:</b> I ate healthy all night and fueled my body with organic energy goos, chia seeds, protein bars, avocados, one turkey sandwich and two peanut butter-covered bagels. I drank more water than I probably ever have in my life. I also took a good many salt pills, six ibuprofen and six DayQuil tablets. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Sleep:</b> I got somewhere around two hours of sleep total. Sleeping in those vans is near impossible. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Conclusion:</b> This event is amazing. My teammates were complete badasses. Also a big shoutout to our driver, High Stick. We couldn’t have done it without his tireless help. Not only did he drive us, but he was also one badass pit crew member—always getting us what we needed both while we ran and while we rested. If you do this event on a six- man ultra team, get you a High Stick.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I started off very badly. After five weeks of being sick and stupidly running the Asheville Marathon with the flu, my body was telling me not to do this race. But I was on a six- man team. I had no choice but to show up and be the best teammate I could be. I cost us some time and I was the weak link, but I redeemed myself with a strong second half.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Next year’s goal is to put together a team that finishes in the top three. Write it down. </span></p>

1083,"How Do You Have So Much Time?","<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">“Time, why you punish me?”</span></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I write this post at 6am after just returning home from a two-hour work out. I’m thinking of one of the last things a co-worker said before we headed out the door for the weekend. She saw that I worked out twice on Friday and asked, “How do you have so much time to work out when I can barely fit </span><span class=""s2"">one</span><span class=""s1""> workout in?”</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">That’s a legitimate question; one that I get a lot. So let me dive in for those of you who want to know how you can fit more workouts, more work, more reading time, more whatever time into your schedule. Here it is…</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>1. Create more time. </b></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Sure, you can’t just add on more time, but you can find more time in the 24 hours you have. And I don’t mean sleep less. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Side note: I hate that one measurement of success is the competition to see who can live off the least sleep. Sleep is important, especially if you work out a lot. </i></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Ready?<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>Here’s the secret:<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">  </span>Go to bed early and wake up before all the chaos starts. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">My alarm went off at 3:30 this morning. I went to bed at 8:30. The kids were down at 7 so I still got 90 minutes to hang out with Elizabeth and watch an hour of TV. Then I got up before all the chaos started (kids screaming, phone blowing up, emails pouring in) and, as I type this, the kids are still asleep. I created more time by simply reorganizing and using time slots that most Americans don’t or refuse to use. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I  know, I know… “I’m just not a morning person.” Seriously, get over yourself. You’re not a morning person because you haven’t really tried. You stay up watching bullshit TV until midnight and then say you can’t wake up at 4am. Well, no shit! Go to bed early.  Next excuse… “I can’t go to bed that early.” Drink two glasses of wine, take a NyQuil and watch Star Trek Voyager. You’ll pass out. In a good way.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>2. Don’t waste time. </b></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Let’s say you sleep 8 hours a day and you work 9 hours (although most of you are only working 8). That’s only 17 hours, which means you have a full 7 hours left. What the hell are you doing? You’re going to spend some time getting showered, dressed, eating and commuting. Let’s say all that takes 4 hours. That’s still 3 hours a day you’re straight up wasting somewhere. I’m going to guess it’s on the couch watching TV.  I’m right, aren’t I?</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I watch TV. Not a lot, but I watch at least an hour a day. It’s the way I shut my brain off at night after going hard all day. I just don’t veg all night in front of a TV.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">How about lunch time?  Are you flaking out for an hour like most folks?  That’s a complete waste of an hour. Today I’m working out twice because I’m going to eat at my desk around 11 am and head to the pool at noon while most folks are on a lunch break. I’ll be able to get in 45 minutes and be back at the office before anyone even realizes I’m gone. That’s because they’ll all be gone.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>3. Plan your day.</b> </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A lot of folks waste time because they have open slots on the schedule and don’t know how to fill them. Not me. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Every minute of my day is booked from the time I wake up to the time I go to bed. I’m able to maximize my time because I analyze it. Meetings are kept short. Phone calls are returned in bulk at specified times. Emails are checked in bulk instead of me staring at a computer screen all day. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>4. Build a life that allows you to dictate your time.</b></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">A lot of this is easy for me to say because I don’t have someone, like a boss, dictating most of my day. That’s not to say I have total freedom to do whatever I want. I have a family. I help out around the house and with the kids. I know that from 7 am - 8 am I need to get Harlowe up and fed and from 8 am - 9:15 am I need to watch the kids so Elizabeth can work out. But let me be honest…the large portion of my day is up to me. That’s the life I’ve built for myself. And, frankly, I’ve worked my ass off for it.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Most of you reading this aren’t entrepreneurs. There’s a huge misconception that it’s all parties, boats and fancy cars. Let me tell you—it’s nothing like that. It’s an incredibly stressful life. Keeping clients happy and making payroll alone is enough to keep me up at night, make me stress-puke some mornings and even fill my mouth and stomach with ulcers. The one payoff is that I get flexibility and no one is telling me what I can and can’t do. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">You can build an entire life that gives you the flexibility I have, but know there’s a lot of negative shit you’ll have to deal with—mentally, emotionally and even physically.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">With that said, you might not be able to plan out your day the way I can. You might not be able to leave for lunch. But you can  go to bed earlier, wake up earlier and not sit in front of a TV for 1/4th of your day.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>5. Find an awesome partner.</b></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">All my accomplishments are also Elizabeth’s. She takes a lot off my plate that allows me to concentrate on our mutual and my personal goals. She takes the kids all day and she handles nearly everything around the house. She handles the finances and pays the bills. She takes care of just about all details because I’m the least detail-oriented person in the world. She lays out my vitamins, packs my lunch and has dinner waiting when I get home.   I could go on and on and on, so let me just say that she’s the perfect wife, an amazing woman and an overall badass partner.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It’s hard to quantify just how much actual time she saves me each day. I just know it’s significant and I couldn’t do half of what I do without her. I’d even go as far as saying that all my time-saving tricks and my ability to knock out tasks and goals are from her teachings. Find you an Elizabeth and you can do just about anything.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">I hope some of this advice can help you find more time in your week, allowing you to knock out some big goals you’ve been waiting to tackle.</span></p>","“Time, why you punish me?”",2017-04-04,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/how-do-you-have-so-much-time/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WesTimeFB.jpg,"How Do You Have So Much Time?",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WesTimeFB.jpg,,Blog|Fitness,"advice|don't waste|plan|time",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,how-do-you-have-so-much-time,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

1101,"Push Does These Three Things","We specialize. Some marketing companies don’t. They claim to do it all. That’s jack of all trades and master of none. “We do TV, we do digital, we do everything…” Really?

You can’t do digital well unless you go ALL in. All in is exactly where you’ll find Push.

Rather than trying to be all things to all clients, we do three things and we do them really well. Ready?

<strong>Push does digital strategy, content creation and advertising. Boom. That’s it.</strong>

We work collaboratively with our clients to develop a comprehensive digital strategy based on their needs, audiences, goals, timelines and budgets. There is no “one-size-fits-all” in digital.

Hell, there’s no “two-size.” We craft a strategy that’s right for you and your messaging.

We pump out a ton of content on a daily basis. A ton. Our team is writing blogs, making videos, designing images, developing websites that are look great and work even better. Mobile-first, idea-first content that audiences love.

Our advertising team is particularly badass with laser-focused plans for reaching your audiences. Your ads are constantly tweaked, analyzed and optimized. Not just placed. Big difference—believe me.

Three things. You want a jet flyover? We can’t help you. Well, I could make a few calls. But three things. We don’t claim to do everything or suggest that everything we do is a proprietary technique. We’re better at bringing it than shoveling it. Our proprietary technique is working our asses off. We can do that for you. In three ways:

<strong>Digital strategy, content creation and adverting.</strong>

Boom.","You can’t do digital well unless you go ALL in.",2017-04-06,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/push-does-these-three-things/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Wes.jpg,"Push Does These Three Things",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Wes.jpg,,Blog,"Push|strategy|three things",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,push-does-these-three-things,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
1109,"We've Hired Our First Sales Person","Once upon a time (always wanted to write that!), Push was me, my laptop and one $500 a month retainer client. I am happy to report that we have grown exponentially since then and are poised for more growth. So <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">much</span> more that I did it—hired our first sales person.

Emzee Hilliard is someone we’ve known around SC political circles for several years, and she joined us on Monday. We’re very excited for her to be here.

Myself, Michael Rentiers, Phil V, Phil Bailey, and Matt Nichols and Brian Athey (since our acquisition of On Point) all work on business development—that is, bringing new clients onboard, following up on referrals and generating leads.

But the reality is, we all find ourselves spending more and more time managing current clients and projects. It’s a good problem to have—great clients and a busy agency. No complaints. Just a question to answer:

So who does biz dev?

The short answer is, all of us will still do some—and Matt Nichols will be leading the process with Emzee working with him. I think it’s going to work out great.

There’s a story about a guy who stopped at a roadside diner called “Mom’s Home Cooking.”
After he ordered, he asked, “Where’ s Mom?” The answer was “She’s home cooking.”

As a business owner, you concentrate on your products. How could you not? If you’re a home builder, you’re likely building homes. If you’re me, you’re developing killer digital strategies. But you MUST have a well-organized, dedicated, focused sales effort for growth. And now we do.

Welcome Emzee when you have a chance. Stop by for a chat (or a beer) when you can.","So who does biz dev?",2017-04-07,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/hired-first-sales-person/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/NewSalesFB.jpg,"We've Hired Our First Sales Person",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/NewSalesFB.jpg,,Blog,hired|Push|sales|team,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,hired-first-sales-person,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
1121,"Building The Empire: From Political Operative to Entrepreneur","<strong>I didn’t set out to be an entrepreneur. </strong>

I set out to be (and became) a political operative.

I went from knocking on doors and putting up yard signs to spending a year in a different state working on a U.S. Senate campaign and helping elect then—U.S. Rep. Jim DeMint to the Senate. I was general consultant on around 50 state legislative races. It was a wild ride and I wasn’t considering starting my own place until I couldn’t convince my bosses of the importance of digital.

I quickly became an entrepreneur, as well as, a political consultant. And I added on even more campaigns, larger campaigns, to my resume.

On the one hand, I still loved the pace, the creativity and the instant metrics of building a campaign. On the other, I found I also liked the idea of building a business from scratch.

For a guy who is not especially handy with a hammer or wrench, I really do LOVE building stuff—like companies and brands.

Becoming an entrepreneur by accident, I “learned by doing” and through a lot of trial and error. Along the way, I realized I just wanted more—more challenges, more different kinds of projects and more business to start. <strong>I want to build more things you can see, touch and experience.</strong>

In the past year alone, that has included building a new brewery for Frothy Beard, opening a new brick-and-mortar restaurant operation for Zombie Bob’s Pizza, re-doing a former church for the new Push worldwide headquarters and acquiring On Point.

<strong>In one year^.</strong>

Today we were taking a staff photo outside and I have to say with pride it took some time to get everyone into the frame. The company is getting bigger. Push has come a long way from me, my laptop and one client. We are still growing and have an AMAZING staff—they impress me (and our clients) every day.

But you can’t get anywhere by standing still. So I’m not. I'm still building Push, building Frothy, building Zombie Bob’s…and maybe working on a new blueprint or two. &#x1f609;","I didn’t set out to be an entrepreneur.",2017-04-11,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/building-empire-political-operative-entrepreneur/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/PushTeamWes.jpg,"Building The Empire: From Political Operative to Entrepreneur",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/PushTeamWes.jpg,,Blog,"building|empire|entrepreneur|Frothy|political operative|Politics|Push|Zombie Bob's",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,building-empire-political-operative-entrepreneur,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
1128,"I Live My Life by the Pareto Principle","Have you heard of the 80/20 rule? It’s really called the Pareto Principle, named after an Italian economist named Vilfredo Pareto. The simple explanation is that <strong>20% of your effort produces 80% of your results.</strong>

For me—and for Push—that means identifying the 20% of the business tasks that are most important, and leaving the remaining 80% for the staff. Or getting rid of it all together.

At one time, I had to do everything, because the whole company was me. I can tell you that “letting go” as an entrepreneur is not easy. I am getting better at it, and I attribute that to a staff that is super talented and has my complete trust.

What I have been trying to do is free myself of many tasks, especially personal ones, so I can concentrate more on sales in general, something I’ve failed to do in the past. That’s why we now have a dedicated sales team led by Matt Nichols and Emzee Hilliard. Very excited about that in many ways.

A lot of business advice books tell you to “only do the tasks that only you can do.” That’s really another restatement of the Pareto Principle. If there’s a task at Push someone else can do, then someone else should do it. It’s not that the tasks are beneath me—quite the opposite. But if I can really concentrate on that 20%, then I know I can totally blow up the 80% results.

I’ve narrowed my 20% down to:
<ul>
 	<li>Strategist and lead creative for our largest clients</li>
 	<li>Overseeing finances</li>
 	<li>Business development</li>
 	<li>Setting the vision and tone of the agency</li>
</ul>
<strong>If it doesn’t fall into one of those buckets, I don’t handle it.</strong>

Academics also call the Pareto Principle the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity. I think Pareto would forgive me if I call it crushing the absolute living sh*t out of growing this company. Because that’s what I’m going to do.","Have you heard of the 80/20 rule?",2017-04-12,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/live-life-pareto-principle/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParetoFB.jpg,"I Live My Life by the Pareto Principle",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ParetoFB.jpg,,Blog,"pareto principle|Push",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,live-life-pareto-principle,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
1132,"Why I Call Out Individuals on Staff When They Drop Balls","Matt Nichols and Brian Athey joined us a few months back when we acquired their firm, On Point. To familiarize themselves with Push and our staff members, Matt and Brian conducted an employee survey. The survey turned out to be helpful for all of us.

One of the findings was that many staff members were nervous about being called out or embarrassed publicly when they’ve dropped the ball. Believe me, that has never been my intent.

In fact, the opposite is true. I think it’s a great opportunity for team building along with being a teachable moment. Why?

For starters, when one person drops the ball, it’s really the whole team that did. Makes sense? You missed a deadline? That means your department did. We’re in this together. And we need have each other’s backs.

Also, we can learn from a mistake. All of us. Here’s what went wrong, here’s why it went wrong, here’s how we’re going to fix it.

I drop balls and call myself on it and learn from it. We’re humans. As awesome as the staff at Push is, we can all still get even better.","We can learn from a mistake.",2017-04-13,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/call-individuals-staff-drop-balls/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WesDroppedBallsFB.jpg,"Why I Call Out Individuals on Staff When They Drop Balls",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WesDroppedBallsFB.jpg,,Blog,"drop balls|learning from mistakes|Push",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,call-individuals-staff-drop-balls,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

1143,"My Journey To Become An Ironman Begins Now","There is a 63-year-old gentleman I befriended a few years ago when I lived in Columbia and attended First Baptist Church. He and his wife are some of the best human beings you'll ever meet. They helped lead our young married couples Sunday school class.

He is a devout Christian, amazing family man, and a successful businessman. He's quiet and humble. I've always looked up to him as the kind of man I want to be. Oh, and one more thing. He is an Ironman. Multiple times over.

Every Wednesday he would buy breakfast for me and a few other young man from our Sunday school class. It was his way of bringing young Christian men together to support one another and to serve as a sort of mentor. This was around the same time I was beginning my athletic journey. I honestly couldn't believe his stories when I asked him what he did before breakfast. Hours in the pool, miles on the road and even more miles on the bike.

I couldn't believe a human could do those things, and is still doing, especially at his age. He was the only Ironman I knew and to this day, despite finishing my fair share of endurance events, I still stand in awe of that accomplishment. I’ve been obsessed with it for years, all because of him. Now I'm ready. I'm ready to begin my journey to become an Ironman.

I just finished an insane string of events. Now it’s time to identify my next goals and start training… lightly and slowing (more on that in a later blog). Those goals are…

1. Become an Ironman
2. Run a 3:30 marathon
3. Run a 50 mile ultra marathon
4. Continue learning through GORUCK

I love the GORUCK community and I’m super pumped they’re launching new events, such as Constellation, where they teach urban survival during a crisis. I’ll keep doing new events to learn new skills and occasionally an event that all my boys sign up for, but honestly, I’m pretty done carrying heavy shit event after event. I’ve carried enough heavy shit for enough hours that I’m pretty confident I can accomplish that task. =) I’m just ready for something new.

My top priorities are regaining my health, speed and endurance. I’ll stop spreading myself too thin by by going back and forth between runs and GORUCK events. I’ll ruck and I’ll continue strength training, but it’s not to carry heavy shit. It’s to become a longer and faster endurance athlete. I believe weekly rucking does that.

So on to triathlons. Just one problem - I can’t really swim. More on that later. I’ll continue updating on how my training is going.
For now, I’m laying out my 2017 - 2018 schedule in hopes that a few of my F3 brothers will take this Ironman journey with me. I could use the extra push and accountability.

Here’s how my 2017 - 2018 event schedule is shaping up:

Jan 14 - Charleston Marathon
Feb 11 - GORUCK Light - Charleston
Feb 17 - GORUCK Heavy - Ft Bragg
Feb 26 - GORUCK Advanced FAD
March 13 - Asheville Marathon
March 24 - Palmetto 200 - Ultra Team
May 21 - Triathlon Sprint Series 1 (maybe - swimming skills may not be ready yet)
June 18 - Triathlon Sprint Series 2
July 9 - Triathlon Sprint Series 3
July 15 - GORUCK Tough - Charleston
July 30 - Triathlon Sprint Series 4
Aug 13 - Triathlon Sprint Series 5
Sept 8 - Blue Ridge Relay - Ultra Team
Sept 17 - Kiawah Triathlon - Olympic distance
Sept 22 - GORUCK Constellation - St Augustine
Oct 21 - Half Ironman - Wilmington
Nov 11 - Sweet Tea Half Marathon
** Nov / Dec - Marathon TBD
Jan 4- Disney - The Dopey 5k
Jan 5- Disney - The Dopey 10k
Jan 6 - Disney - The Dopey Half Marathon
Jan 7 - Disney - The Dopey Marathon
March 2017 - Peyton’s Wild and Whacky 50k

1155,"I Made a Mistake","You know what they say—smart people learn from their mistakes, but <em>smarter</em> people learn from <em>other</em> people’s mistakes. Be smarter. Take me up on my offer.

I read a lot of books on entrepreneurial tips. Listen to motivational speakers. And I follow advice on working out, nutrition and health. One common theme among them all is push, push, push (you know, that would make a good name for a company). Crush it. Work harder. Test your limits. Stop at nothing.

So I did all of those. I scheduled more half- and full marathons, more challenging GORUCK events, more difficult F3 events. I ran more, lifted more, exercised more, pushed more. Another mile. Another weight. Another hour.

And, finally, I basically collapsed. I listened to everyone and everything except for my own body. And it has been <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">telling</span> me for a while now to take it easy. In the case of my immune system, it was <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">screaming</span> at me.

From the flu to colds to a sinus infection, I was sick for almost two straight months. I was even crazy enough to run a marathon while that sick. But enough was enough.

I decided to take a stay-cation leading up to Easter and it did me a world of good. Truly. <span class=""s1"">What better time than during the season of renewal?</span>

I relaxed, spent some time just enjoying the beach, Charleston and (especially) my family.

My mistake is I overdid it. I learned there is a limit. I learned I need to take a break. Everyone does. That doesn’t mean stop. It means slow down from time to time.

Just to be clear: I’m not changing the name the company to Sit On Your Ass Digital. We’re still pushing. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">I’m</span> still pushing.

</b>This book urges you to get faster, go longer and extend your athletic life by slowing down and eating a primal diet. I’m 100% bought in. Let's see if I can jump start my ketogenic diet with no beer over the next 21 days. Wish me luck. YAY vodka!

<b>3. <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/80025744"">Sense8</a>
</b>Hailed by the LBTGQ community as the gayest show on television, Sense8 is what happens when you blend the X-Men with a liberal and globalist agenda. The sci-fi premise and amazing action is enough of a reason to watch, even if you aren’t into gay sex and orgies. Okay conservatives, don’t let that scare you off. I’m telling you - this is one of the best shows on TV.

<b>4. <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/80067617"">Into the Badlands</a>
</b>AMC’s Into the Badlands is what happens when you mix martial arts, the post-apocolpyse and <em>magic</em>. It straight up has the best action of any show on TV. If you like Tarantino style blood and guts, you’re going to enjoy this show.

<b>5. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i7usq6NLfM"">Harlowe’s Hats</a>
</b>You missed it. I’m sorry. Try again next May 4th. Last week we released a very limited amount of Harlowe’s Hats, our peanut butter and banana porter brewed for Harlowe’s birthday. Next year we will brew a lot more.

<b>6. <a href=""https://swimbikerunfarm.com/"">Endurance Farm</a>
</b>Endurance Farm is the name of my swim instructor, Chris’, company. With his help, on a scale of 1 - 10, I’ve gone from about a 1 to a 3 in just month. I don’t feel like a dolphin yet, but I also don’t feel like I’m drowning. If you’re a Charleston area wannabe athlete looking into triathlons, I strongly encourage you to talk to Chris.

Training has been going well. On a scale of 1 - 10, I’ve gone from a one to a three in the pool, thanks to private lessons from my badass trainer, Chris. I simply cannot rave about Endurance Farm enough. <a href=""https://swimbikerunfarm.com/"">Check them out here</a>. I’m swimming three times a week, two of which are private lessons.

I’ve cut back a great deal on running. I’m running four times a week for about 20 miles. Nothing big. Also, I've slowed down A LOT to stay in an aerobic zone. I wrote about that a bunch just a few weeks back. Basically, I’ve gone so hard for three years that I’ve overtrained in an anaerobic zone and totally crushed my base. Now is the time to take a step back and start over.

Recently, I bought a pretty nice Felt tri bike and I took it out for the third time this past<span class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_716689698""><span class=""aQJ""> Sunday. This ride</span></span> was also my third brick training, which is when you stack multiple sports in a training session. In this case, I had planned on riding and running. I’ve been trying to ride 13 - 15 miles and then run 3 - 5 miles, about the distance of a sprint triathlon.

Unfortunately, chaos ensued <span class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_716689699""><span class=""aQJ"">on Sunday</span></span> when I was racing home as fast as I could. I was scheduled to watch the boys while Elizabeth did some church thing. About half a mile from home... I hit something. Perhaps it was a pot hole, I’m not really sure what it was, but I lost my balance and just remember the front wheel going nuts. I knew I was going down, so instead of putting my hands straight down, I tried rolling. It didn’t work out very well since my entire left side hit the pavement hard, with my left elbow taking the brunt of the force. I laid bloody on the side of the road for a few minutes until a dude on a moped came by and helped me up. I got back on the bike with blood dripping everywhere and road home.

I’m pretty banged up, but luckily not seriously injured. The scrapes are healing nicely but there’s a big ole chunk of meat missing from my elbow. It looks like ground beef. And I can barely move my elbow at all. Ugh…

That means I’m out of the pool, out of the gym and out of bootcamps for at least a week. I doubt I can get into the right position to bike either since I can’t put pressure on my left arm. I’m going to try running a good 20 miles this week. Wish me luck...

It feels like it’s always something setting me back. As soon as I feel good physically and get into the right mindset, something goes wrong.

Before I sign off, one more quick thing. I’m attempting the ketogenic diet again. I’m currently on day 4. Eating right has been pretty easy because I eat healthy anyway and rarely have a sweet tooth. However, not having beer is killing me. I mean, I work in a craft brewery. It’s effing torture. I drank a couple of vodka sodas this weekend and last night I drank two straight shots of mezcal. I guess for now... I’ll just have to drink straight liquor like a hardcore baller. Fake it till you make it, baby!

Fake it till you make it.","And how my elbow got shredded like hamburger meet.",2017-05-09,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/continuing-journey-toward-tattoo/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Untitled-design-5.png,"Digital Advocacy Was The Game-Changer For Fixing Your Roads","digital advocacy fixed sc roads",,"digital advocacy fixed sc roads",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Untitled-design-5.png,,Blog|Fitness,"endurance|ironman|Ironman journey|tattoo|triathalon|wipe out",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,continuing-journey-toward-tattoo,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

In between all of the festivities, I debated  a personal blogging dilemma that's been plaguing me the past couple of weeks. Then I met with Emzee (our new sales person) to drop some time management knowledge.

1188,"To Blog, Or Not To Blog.","I blog regularly. I also regularly question whether or not I should. Here’s why:

For one thing, talking about <i>clients</i> (candidates or causes or companies) in a positive way has always come very naturally to me. I could go on and on (and probably do) about how great our clients are.

By the same token, bragging about yourself (me or Push) feels different. And some of my “friends” jokingly (or is that non-jokingly?)  have accused me of being narcissistic or douchey for blogging. Dang.

Maybe I need some new friends. Because here’s the deal—yes, I am hot and cold on blogging. But if we don’t market ourselves, no one else will. It IS more difficult to have yourself as a client. If you don’t believe me, try writing your bio.

But we have to market ourselves. Have to. We also have to PLAN for our internal marketing because, of course, we are busy up to here (hand over head) with work for our clients. Not complaining. Love them and love being busy. But we can’t be too busy to take care of Push. Because we have a great story to tell.

Also, while our company has other offices, we are based in Charleston. That means we are not constantly at parties and happy hours on the Hill in Washington, nor are we regularly at meetings and conferences and dinners in New York. We DO travel a lot so we are OFTEN in DC or New York (or Tampa, or Atlanta, or San Antonio, or San Diego…), but to stay “top of mind” with the right people we need to pump out content they will see and like. Simple as that.

Short answer?  I’m getting back to blogging.  I’ll make it worth your time. And, as always, if you have any questions or need a hand, with something, you know how to reach me or the rest of our talented (and growing) team.","AKA Narcissistic & Douchey—is that a law firm?!",2017-05-12,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/blog-not-blog/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/170512_Push_Blogging_FeaturedImage.jpg,"To Blog, Or Not To Blog.","To Blog Or Not To Blog",,"To Blog or Not To Blog",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/170512_Push_Blogging_FeaturedImage.jpg,,Blog,"blog|blogging|dilemma|Douchey|internal marketing|narcissistic",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,blog-not-blog,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

I’m older now, and I have more responsibilities—especially an awesome wife and two small children. I need and want to spend as much time as I can with them, meaning I don’t have as much time to spend at the office. So when I AM at the office it’s meeting, meeting, meeting, meeting.

And when I travel—like going to DC this week—I want to be sure this time away from my family is 100% utilized.

No lollygagging is allowed. None.

From the time the plane takes off until it lands back in Charleston, I want a schedule that maximizes every single second of the day. Getting together with clients, talking to prospective ones, reaching out to contacts on the Hill, etc. Coffee, beer, dinner?  Business, business, business.

I work best with a tight schedule and a full workload. Good thing, right? But it has to be that way.

It really does. It only works for me, my family and Push (and Frothy)(and Zombie Bob’s)(and…) if I work as efficiently as possible. Meaning full tilt. BOOM. Let’s go.

1. <a href=""https://www.hulu.com/the-handmaids-tale"">Handmaid’s Tale</a>
The Hulu original series is based on a best selling novel and stars Elizabeth Moss (“Mad Men”). It takes place in a dystopian future where only a few women CAN reproduce and they are sold as slaves to reproduce for the families of the powerful and rich. Pretty freaking amazing and quickly becoming one of my favorite TV shows. <em><em>Highly recommended.</em></em>

2. <a href=""https://www.birddogs.com/collections/the-gym-shorts"">Birddogs</a>
They're a brand of athletic shorts I bought after seeing an ad on Facebook (read the last part again silently to yourself) that was targeted to athletes and entrepreneurs. Most comfortable shorts I have ever owned—so comfortable I sometimes think I’m not wearing anything and have to check. Get A PAIR.

3. <a href=""http://www.zombiebobspizza.com/"">Zombie Bob’s Pizza
</a>It was only a matter of time before Frothy and Zombie Bob's joined the brunch bandwagon. Last week they rolled a new brunch menu featuring breakfast pizzas, special drinks and much more…including THE BEST cinnamon roll I have had in my entire life.

4. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Raising-Men-Lessons-Learned-Training/dp/125009173X"">Raising Men
</a>This book is by a former Navy SEAL who talks about how to raise boys, using lessons learned from SEAL training. This is important to me since I was raised mainly by women, have two sons and had ZERO training in this area.

</a>This one is already one of my favorite seven things but I have rediscovered a NEW LOVE for it. I am finding all kinds of great, helpful “how-to” videos like ones that help me with triathlon training. Coincidentally, I am watching almost no broadcast television.

The hobby becomes a lot less fun when you must do it, when money becomes the object and when there are mouths to feed. That's the way I feel about craft beer right now, especially since I'm playing with this damn ketogenic diet that prohibits beer.</p>
<p class=""m_4577049708246463352inbox-inbox-p1"">There are many reasons I bought into Frothy Beard specifically, but from a big picture standpoint, I bought into a brewery because I wanted an entrepreneurial venture that isn't politics. What I quickly learned is that all business is political in someway, especially a business based on alcohol. We live in a nation that tells you anything is possible with hard work. But that's not the case when your business is over regulated and your prosperity is based on the hard work of other companies government forces you to use and doesn't even allow you to fire. I love our distribution partners but I am and always will be against overregulation</p>
<p class=""m_4577049708246463352inbox-inbox-p1"">Here in South Carolina we are continuing our march forward toward progressive beer laws. We've passed four huge laws <span class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1171148817""><span class=""aQJ"">in seven years</span></span>. That doesn't even count the Pop The Cap law that was passed before I came around. We've gone from being one of the worst states for craft beer to being one of the best. Just last week two new laws were signed that will help craft breweries continue to grow. The press release is pasted below. Thank you for all your support of our brewery and all craft breweries in South Carolina again.</p>

<div class=""entry-content"">
<p class=""m_-5605508429936789560article-title"" align=""left""><strong>South Carolina Continues March Toward Being The Best State For Craft Breweries</strong></p>

<div class=""m_-5605508429936789560article-content"" align=""left"">

(Columbia, SC) – For the fourth time in just 7 years, the South Carolina legislature has passed new legislation, signed into law by the Governor, that fundamentally changes the craft beer scene in South Carolina.

S .114 allows craft breweries to donate their product to charities, in an effort to support the many good causes across South Carolina providing help to our state’s residents. It also allows brewers to participate in nonprofit events by pouring product and providing equipment.

S .275 allows breweries to sell liquor, which is particularly helpful to the brewpubs in South Carolina planning to distribute their product, most notably Hunter Gatherer in Columbia and Edmund’s Oast In Charleston.

Both bills were sponsored by South Carolina beer hero State Senator Sean Bennett (R – Dorchester) and gained bipartisan support in both chambers.

In 2013, South Carolina passed the Pint Law allowing craft brewers to sell pints on premise. In 2014, the Stone Law was passed allowing breweries to sell food on premise. These two new laws continue a trend of South Carolina’s lawmakers supporting the booming craft beer industry.

According to SC Brewers Guild Executive Director Brook Bristow, because of these laws, the state has gone from 8 to 41 breweries. “It’s exploding,” he says “in large part due to bipartisan support from legislators like Senator Sean Bennett and Representative Leon Stavirnakis.”

“We just want to thank the legislature and the Governor for supporting the hard working small business owners who are helping fuel the state’s tourism industry,” said Chris Brown, president of the SC Craft Brewers Guild and co-owner of Holy City Brewing Company.

“We’ve gone from being one of the worst states for craft beer to being one of the best,” said Wesley Donehue of Frothy Beard Brewing. “If this trend continues, South Carolina will be one of the best states on the east coast for craft beer. We’ll bring in more tourists and create even more jobs. Let’s continue the march forward.”

After a nasty bike crash and a week on the road, I’m finally back to my normal workout schedule. I’m absolutely mentally and physically exhausted from an intense work schedule so I’m using my workouts as my ""relaxation"" time - my escape from the rest of the world. I know, working out isn’t that relaxing. It’s just the opposite. But it gives my brain an escape from all the bullshit that is work and politics.

Just a quick thank you to all my buddies who read this and who keep me accountable, especially my F3 brothers, all the triathletes I’ve been reaching out to lately and my Frothy partner Steve who is jumping into some of this craziness with me.

1229,"You Can't Just ""Do Digital Too.""","OK—I’m totally calling BS on political consulting firms and marketing agencies in general that claim they “do digital, too.” I’m sure it's easy to <i>say</i>—but I can tell you from experience that it isn’t easy to do.

I left the company I was working for when they couldn’t see digital as the future, coming straight down the road at them with brights on. So I started my own company and have worked for myself ever since.

And, yes, a few years back we would get excited because we had a banner ad in the header on <a href=""http://espn.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://espn.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1495832641815000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpPF3eoWaQH7NAT4ZTMv97Qv4etQ"">ESPN.com</a>. The industry has come a long way. I and my company have grown up in it and with it. The growth has been phenomenal.

Think about it. The spend is bigger on digital now than it is on TV. Bigger than TV. And people “watch TV” now on just about anything <b>but</b> a TV, and on just about any “network” except for ABC, NBC and CBS.

So the TV firms are saying they “do digital, too”? I guess if I had a TV firm I might say that also.

But you can’t just hire two kids out of college and say you have a digital department. You don’t.

Digital isn’t just intense—it’s complex. You'd have to have a full design department and video capabilities and data and project managers and advertising experts and oh, strategists who live and breathe digital because it changes literally overnight. Otherwise, you’re missing the point.

Digital is getting so big, so fast—some of the disciplines could be separate companies. Like data and analytics. Hmmm…maybe I’ll start one.

For years and years, political general consultants have sold against digital firms, tried (successfully at times) to grab 100% of the media placement budget, and otherwise treated digital companies like second-class citizens. The world is turning and those same consulting firms have changed their tune because they’re chasing the dollar with no clue what they are really doing.

1237,"Push Digital Expands With New Hires","We're growing and growing and growing. Literally, right now, our staff is sitting on top of each other here at Push. We have people sitting at tables, desks, and scattered amongst the brewery. This truly is a great problem to have. Not to give too much away, but that problem will be fixed very soon. I'm on it.

I've mentioned this before, but we've shifted our strategy. Typically during this period of the political cycle, firms like ours start firing. But not us. We're hiring.
<p style=""text-align: center;"">---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
(Charleston, SC) — Push Digital, the Charleston, SC-based digital marketing agency known nationally for its expertise in political campaigns and online advocacy, recently hired three new communications professionals, according to Wesley Donehue, the Founder and CEO of Push.

In welcoming Lindsay DeTroia, Sierra Mascilak and Emzee Hilliard, Donehue said, “I’ve been telling people we have the largest and most talented staff we’ve ever had—and now it’s even better. These new hires are great for our clients and for Push. We have the largest political agency in South Carolina and we are one of the largest in the Southeast.”

“We are already bursting at the seams of our new headquarters,” Donehue said, referring to the converted church in West Ashley that houses Push, Frothy Beard Brewing and Zombie Bob’s Pizza. “But rapid growth is a good problem to have.”

DeTroia, a native of New Jersey, earned her Bachelor of Science degree in Visual Journalism from West Virginia University. She joined Push as an Account Executive.

Mascilak, also a Garden State native, graduated from Towson University with a Bachelor of Science in Mass Communications and has joined the advertising department at Push.

Hilliard, from Bennettsville, SC, studied at the University of South Carolina, earned her BA in Spanish and Psychology and graduated cum laude. She went on to do her graduate work at the Medical University of South Carolina. Hilliard is joining Push in a new role—Deputy Director of Business Development.

Matt Nichols, Director of Business Development at Push, explains: “Several of us at Push work on new business, but  we are also extremely busy with current clients. Having a dedicated biz dev staff is another step in Push’s growth as a company.”

Push Digital’s clients include SeaWorld, Airlines for America, the
American Chemistry Council and Home Shopping Network. The firm is also known for having worked on Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign and his senate re-election.","CEO says move is based on “rapid growth.”",2017-06-01,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/push-digital-expands-new-hires/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/170516_Push_NewHires_300x475.jpg,"Push Digital Expands With New Hires","Push Digital Expands With New Hires",,"Push Digital Expands With New Hires",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/170516_Push_NewHires_300x475.jpg,,Blog,"agency|expands|growth|marketing|new hires|politcal|press release|push digital",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,push-digital-expands-new-hires,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
1241,"7 Amazing Things That Are Badass And Perhaps Even Magical, Part 4","I’m still playing with the best way of recommending things I love to you. Let’s see if this “What I’m” format works.  Here you go…

1.<a href=""http://www.broadway.com/shows/1984-broadway/""> What I'm Watching: </a></b>I just left New York City where I caught George Orwell’s 1984 on Broadway staring Olivia Wilde. This play is definitely not for everyone. It’s weird, loud and includes incredible bursts of light. It’s violent and disturbing. In other words, it’s everything I love.

2.<a href=""https://dailyaudiobible.com/""> What I’m Listening To:</a></b> I’ve listen to the Daily Audio Bible Podcast every single day going on three years. It just occurred to me that I’ve never recommended it to you. I always wanted to read the Bible the entire way through but I kept dropping the ball. Now I’m on my third time through. Check it out. Also, I recommend 2X speed. The author is great but pretty slow

3. <a href=""https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app"">What I’m Doing:</a></b> I’m back to meditating every day. My stress level has recently been the highest it’s ever been to the point where I want to punch walls throughout the day. Or just hide in a corner and <em>cry</em>. Meditating gets my mind right. Try the Headspace app. It’s a lifesaver

4. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Flow-State-Runner-Activate-Powerful/dp/3952466700"">What I’m Reading:</a></b> Speaking of meditation, I’m reading a great book that is teaching me how to zone out and go zen during my runs. It’s Flow State Runner by Jeff Grant. I’ve already started implementing it’s first recommendations. For example, this morning I ran to African drum music. It helped some, but I have a long way to go

5. <a href=""http://www.zombiebobspizza.com/2017/06/02/two-new-finger-eating-lunch-specials/"">What I’m Eating</a>:</b> I’m still going in and out of ketosis. It’s been super hard due to Memorial Day weekend and three weeks of traveling. But I’m trying hard. Speaking of eating healthier, Zombie Bob’s Pizza is rolling out a new lunch menu including wraps and new salads. I literally just had the best wrap ever and tasted one (just one) of the absolute best croutons I’ve ever put in my mouth. It rolls out next week

6. What I’m Drinking: </b>Vodka. Lots and lots of vodka waters. The hardest part of the ketogenic diet has been staying away from the beer. This isn’t a recommendation as much as it is a complaint to hold this spot in the blog series for when I’m back on beer

7. What I’m Working On:</b> Outside of huge client work, including SeaWorld who has me insanely busy, I’m working on Phase 2 of the  Frothy / Push expansion. For Frothy we’re getting the patio fixed up by laying down a wooden deck and adding additional enhancements. We’re in talks with our landlord and received amazing architectural drawings for the Push expansion into the next door space. I can’t wait to show you more of that

I hope you have found something cool here to try.

1246,"The Struggle Is Real: Being An Entrepreneur, Husband, Father & Wannabe Endurance Athlete.","<div class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa"">

My wife, Elizabeth, is out on a run, my seven month old, Tennyson, is crying his friggin head off and my three year old, Harlowe, is screaming for me to wipe his bottom. I’ll be right back.

Harlowe is taken care of and I’m now typing with one hand while holding Tennyson with the other. Somehow I have to fit in a run, a core workout, a mobility workout and a shower before I leave for work in 70 minutes. I can’t do any of that until Elizabeth gets back so I might as well write.

I enjoy writing. It’s a creative outlet for me, but I’ve been struggling to find a clear path for my blog. I’m writing a little about everything - business, politics, digital marketing, working out and other shit I just like. Then finally this morning it dawned on me - just be real. Tell the story of this path I’m on and how damn hard it is.

I’m not going to lie. I’ve been struggling a lot over the past few years. I desperately want to grow my companies and I’ve found a new passion for entrepreneurship where as before I was just a political hack. Nothing is more important than my family. I spend all my “spare time” training for crazy endurance events, which right now is my journey to become an Ironman. Seriously, I’m having a very hard time balancing all that and just keeping it together. And by “it” I mean everything - my business, my family and my sanity.

Today the Internet is flooded with click bait articles telling you how easy it is to succeed by following a few simple steps.

Turn Your Kids Into The Best Human Beings Alive In 7 Easy Steps...

Follow These 8 Tricks To Run a Three Hour Marathon...

How These Rockstars Built Multi-Million Dollar Businesses By Stretching In The Morning...

It’s all fake bullshit. These writers look like super heroes instead of reflecting the struggles of everyday life. Can’t we be real? Where’s the transparency and authenticity?

This shit ain’t easy. It’s incredibly hard, y’all. And if we really want to help people we will tell them exactly what’s up.

<strong>Here’s the real story:</strong>

I stress puke some mornings when I think about payroll.
Harlowe often curses because I’m a dick who can’t watch his mouth.
I honestly don’t know why Elizabeth is still with me.
I absolutely hate the way my body works and looks.

Despite the struggle, life is great. My family is healthy, beautiful and the light of my life. My businesses are growing. My staff is amazing. I’m accomplishing physical feats I never thought I could possibly accomplish. My life is amazing. But keeping it amazing takes every ounce of energy in my body and every minute of every hour of every day I think it’s going to fall apart.

Ignore all the fake bullshit click bait articles. If you want to know the real story, here it is. It’s a struggle, but somehow it’s a manageable struggle if you just follow these 5 easy steps. Just kidding. :)

That’s the story I’m going to tell on my blog. A real one. No bullshit. Stay tuned.

1261,"What's In My Kit","Last week a buddy asked, “What all do you have in your kit?” I started pulling out a wide variety of objects and thought, “Man, this might be blog worthy.” I know it’s a silly thing to concentrate on, but I’m always perfecting what I carry on my back. Maybe it’s not silly. I mean, this is my life for the day, especially when I travel.

I’d love to know what’s in your kit. As a follow up, I’ll be writing about what’s in my go bag, which I’m currently working on because, yes, I’m becoming a ""doomesdayer.""

1. <a href=""https://www.goruck.com/collections/shop-all/"">Ruck</a>: I’m currently carrying the SD20 which is a cheap small day pack version of the<a href=""https://www.goruck.com/gr1/""> GR1</a>. It’s okay, but I don’t love it. I prefer carrying the GR1 daily but after 15 events mine stinks like death, despite excessive cleaning, and I’ve been too cheap to just buy a second one for day use. When traveling I switch out the SD20 for the <a href=""https://www.goruck.com/gr2/"">GR2</a>, which I absolutely adore.

2. <a href=""https://www.goruck.com/"">GORUCK</a> Normandy Tough Patch: One year ago this week, I completed the GORUCK Normandy Heavy, Tough and Light events, which lasted about 50 hours and absolutely kicked my ass. I carry the Tough patch daily to remind myself that I can do just about anything I put my mind too with enough training and persistence.

3. <a href=""https://www.beatsbydre.com/"">Beats by Dre</a>: Music is everything to me and I suffer from extreme audio ADD. I don’t even know if that’s a real thing, but that’s what I call it because I cannot concentrate with loud or annoying background noise.

4. Book: Despite trying to minimize my life with the iPad, I just love holding a real book. I’m almost always reading 2 - 3 different books at a time while listening to an additional one on Audible. At least one of those books is a real one stored in the ruck. Currently it’s <em><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Way-Iceman-Health-Using-Cold-Training-Commitment-ebook/dp/B01N1UGTF9"">The Way of the Iceman</a>, </em> which is about the Wim Hof Method.

5. <a href=""https://www.apple.com/ipad/"">iPad</a>: I’m currently trying to stay off the MacBook Air by using my iPad more. I find the iPad less distracting but also, because it’s smaller and handheld, it’s easier to read on allowing me to pack it full of magazines and books, thus minimizing my life. At some point I hope I can go down to one device only.

6. Journal: As much as I love my phone and iPad, nothing will ever replace the joy of writing in a real journal. Also, you just look rude typing away on a phone or iPad during a meeting. Lately I’ve been using a <a href=""https://www.barnesandnoble.com/b/home-gifts/journals/leather-journals/_/N-8qgZ1hgc"">Barnes and Noble</a> punctuate journal and Narrow Gate Artisans leather cover.

Pen: I forgot to include the pen in this pic. Oops. I always use a blue <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/FORAY-Liquid-Rollerball-Metal-Barrel/dp/B00F63GMW6"">Foray Liquid Ink Rollerball 0.55 mm pen</a> and I’m pretty demanding that my staff always keep them stocked in the office.

7. Workout journal: I keep all my daily workouts, goals and plans in a separate journal.

8. Glock 9mm: Some will argue that I should not publicize that I carry because I might become a target. I argue that knowing I carry will deter and you will have to be some crazy son of a bitch to go after a guy you know is carrying and trained up. I have my 9mm in my ruck at all times that I legally can as well a 380 in my pocket.

9. Mags: For when shit gets real real, I have two extra mags of 17 rounds in a holster ready.

10. <a href=""https://risebar.com/"">Protein bar</a>: It’s healthier than snacking on sugary processed junk food. I always have one, unless I already ate it.

11. <a href=""https://www.nalgene.com/?gclid=CKOAp9H6qdQCFdgBgQodYtYH6g&amp;s_kwcid=AL%213652%213%21144061714526%21p%21%21g%21%21water%20bottles&amp;ef_id=WJNb2gAAAIDTcTGv%3A20170606193122%3As"">Nalgene bottle</a>: Because I drink a shit ton of water all day.

12. Koozie: Because I also drink a shit ton of beer and no good southerner leaves the house without one. Currently, I’m sporting a great one by <a href=""http://onpointsupply.co/"">On Point Supply Company</a>.

13. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Stanley-84-519K-12-in-1-Multi-Tool/dp/B001LUMZHO/ref=sr_1_2?s=power-hand-tools&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1496777600&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=multi+tool"">Multitool</a>: It’s just commonsense to carry one if you’re a dude. Or maybe if you’re just a human. Shit breaks and you have to fix it on the fly.

14. <a href=""https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/"">MacBook Air</a>: It’s the best computer I’ve ever owned. Light, portable, fast and awesome.

15. The Black Notebook: I like printing important documents and other items I have to review so that I can write all over them. Although I keep my schedule electronically, I keep a copy of all big items (out of town trips, big meetings) in a printed calendar also. This notebook contains urgent items I need to review and it’s always with me.

16. Sunglasses: Nothing can ruin a day like not having a good pair of shades ready. Typically I sport the Ray-Ban Wayfarers but this week I’m at the beach sporting the cheaper <a href=""https://wanderand.co/collections/sunglasses/products/wander-co-bamboo-arm-sunglasses-tortise"">Wander &amp; Co</a> plastic rims with bamboo arms.

17. Chargers: This is the most annoying part of my kit. I hate cords. I have them all packed in one bag. They include: Dual outlet for usb, 2 iPhone/iPad cords, watch charger, mini usb, HDMI adapter, MacBook Air cord, earbuds.

18. iPad keyboard:The <a href=""http://www.brookstone.com/pd/Folding-Bluetooth-Keyboard/849391.html?bkeid=compare%7Cmercent%7Cgooglebaseads%7Csearch&amp;bkeid=compare%7cmercent%7cgooglebaseads%7csearch"">Brookstone folded keyboard</a> is just perfect for travel. This device has gotten me through many trips when I tried to go minimal without the MacBook Air and is helping in my goal to go down to just one devise.

19. External charger: I’ve tried multiple external chargers and the <a href=""http://www.mophie.com/shop/charge-force-charging-base"">Mophie</a> is hands down the best. It’s durable, it charges fast and is small and light.

1269,"Digital Advocacy Was The Game-Changer For Fixing Your Roads","After three years of legislative debate, the South Carolina General Assembly passed an increase in the state’s gas tax, dedicating additional funding to fix the state’s notoriously poor and deadly roads and bridges.

Not coincidently, three years ago Push Digital was hired by an association called the South Carolina Alliance to Fix Our Roads to manage their messaging and digital advocacy campaign.

“Everyone said that raising the gas tax to fund road improvements would never happen in such a conservative state,” said Push Digital’s President for Brands and Advocacy, Michael Rentiers. “At first glance it seemed like an almost impossible challenge back then.”

“I know we can do this,” said Bill Ross, President and CEO of the South Carolina Alliance to Fix Our Roads. “Digital Advocacy will be the way to organize regular South Carolinians and have their voices heard.”

The Alliance and Push pressed forward.

“Our team at Push understood that we had to change the rules of the game and to use our best tools to our advantage,” said Rentiers. “The debate wasn’t about taxes but about how our roads were affecting your everyday life.”

Over the three-year period the issue steadily became a higher priority in the State house.

“At the very beginning, road funding and repair was polling very low as a priority for voters in South Carolina. As the #FixSCRoads campaign grew and took off, we saw the issue become the number one priority for voters. Sometimes triple the next priority issue,” said Push Digital’s Founder and CEO Wes Donehue.

“We changed the narrative from a tax-and-spend issue,” said Push’s Columbia office director and the point person for Push on the #FixSCRoads campaign, Phil Bailey. “South Carolinians know our roads are terrible. Folks got a chance to talk about the roads where they live and say THEIR roads stink, not just THE roads. Now let’s talk about fixing them.”

Using highly targeted digital advertising to drive constituents to a website where they could contact their lawmakers was the linchpin of the campaign.

The #FixSCRoads campaign culminated in hundreds of thousands of social media comments, more than 25,000 emails to legislators (in 2017 alone), statewide media coverage of the campaign and the issue becoming personal for many South Carolinians.

“The Alliance couldn’t have done it without the creative and compelling work from the Push team,” said Ross. “They really helped us finally get a bill past the finish line and into law and it was amazing to see the effect digital advocacy has on the real world.”

Push Digital is the South Carolina’s largest digital creative agency with offices in Charleston, Columbia and Washington, DC. The agency specializes in public relations, crisis communications, brand management and issue advocacy. Push also has a full-service political communications division and works with national corporations, associations and campaigns with a focus on digital communications advertising.

The South Carolina Alliance to Fix Our Roads is a non-partisan, non-profit, statewide organization made up of business leaders, associations, and chambers of commerce who believe that an efficient and safe highway system is essential to South Carolina’s continued economic growth and prosperity.","To say that I'm proud of my team is an understatement.

1273,"Make A Decision","It’s said that great leaders are great decision makers. They both decide and act quick. My primary job as the CEO of Push is to be the chief decision maker. However, lately I have found myself suffering with decision paralysis and opting for the “let me think about it” excuse.

<strong>Reason #1: The sheer amount of decisions hitting my plate.</strong>

Large decisions should not be delayed and should be made as soon as possible, but many deserve a lot of thought and input from other members of my team and maybe even outside experts.

Small decisions, on the other hand, can almost all be made by me alone and should be made immediately.

But as I grow Push, take on bigger clients and grow my little entrepreneurial empire, small decisions are coming at me faster and in multitudes. I’ve been so overwhelmed with the small decisions that they're creating a clog and backing up the entire process, thus delaying the big decisions from getting the thoughtful consideration they deserve.

<strong>Reason #2: Emotional roadblocks.</strong>

I’m an emotional guy. You probably know that by now. I’m not the stone cold business owner who makes every decision based on money. Sometimes I wish I were, but money just isn’t my motivator. Still, it’s important that while I shouldn’t be cold, I must begin making more decisions based on profit, for the overall health of the company and for the benefit of the team as a whole instead of letting emotions get in the way.

I started Push by myself. No partners. No investors. I grew the company by adding one staffer at a time as I could afford it instead of hiring a whole bunch of folks all at one time, like many of my competitors. In doing so the team always felt more like a family than a company. We’ve had past teammates that weren’t pulling their weight, didn’t fit our culture or were just toxic. I let my emotions get in the way instead of firing them. It was a mistake. I should have made the decision and let them go. It won’t happen again.

<strong>Solution #1: A new mantra.</strong>

I believe in mantras. I use them in my training, in my endurance events and in meditation. I repeat a saying to put my mind in a good place but also to drill that thought into my head, not just while working out or meditating, but for the entire day. “Embrace the suck.” “Relax.” “Peace.”

In this case, I’m constantly repeating to myself throughout the day “make a decision, make a decision, make a decision.” It doesn’t just come in handy for work, but even more important, when the wife asks “what do you want to do for dinner?” =) In all seriousness, as the man I am the head of the household and it’s vital that while Elizabeth surely gives her input and makes a ton of decisions, there are many times where, like work, I must be the chief decision maker. “Make a decision, make a decision, make a decision.”

<strong>Solution #2: Empower more decision makers.</strong>

I’m a big believer in the Pareto Principle - 80% of your results come from 20% of your actions - so only do the 20% that matters and eliminate or sub out the other 80%.

In this case, it’s time to sub out a lot of the smaller decisions by empowering my senior team, most notably Phil, Michael and Matt. They already do make a lot of the client decisions, but now I must empower them even more to make internal decisions like business development, processes and staffing.

<strong>Next step: Share your struggles too.</strong>

As I wrote last week, I’m going to start talking a lot more about the struggles I'm facing. I hope you will also share your struggles and what you’re doing to move past them.","And act immediately.",2017-06-08,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/make-a-decision/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC00742.jpg,"Make A Decision","make a decision",,"make a decision",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DSC00742.jpg,,Blog,"decision|decision making|large|make a decision|small|stress|struggle|thought|time",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,make-a-decision,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

While we're welcoming lots of friendly new faces to the office, we also had to take a moment and bid a bittersweet goodbye to the longest serving Push employee, Jonathan Williams.

1294,"Declaration Draft: A Little Taste Of Charleston History","You guys... our recent collab could be the most Charleston-y thing we've ever done.

Recently, our buddies at Anson Mills partnered up with Middleton Place to grow a special variety of Carolina Gold Rice right on the historic plantation. Then once the rice was harvested, we used the cereal to brew a beer for the Piccolo Spoleto finale.

Fun fact, Arthur Middleton signed the Declaration of Independence, which made naming this Golden Ale a no brainer. We've dubbed it the Declaration Draft.

At 5.5%, this Golden Ale is light and crisp with a hoppy nose supplied by a healthy dose of East Kent Golding hops. Watch the video below to learn more about Frothy Beard's latest brew.

1297,"What Not To Do In The Morning If You Want To Be Productive And Happy","I skipped my workout this morning, opting for two afternoon workouts. My body told me to rest and I’m trying to finally listen. I laid in bed with my iPad and opened up Feedly, the app I use to consume most of my news. I scrolled through all the bullshit clickbait articles telling me how easy it is to make millions of dollars and live the rest of my life on a private island with my perfect little family. You know - <a href=""http://wesleydonehue.com/the-struggle-is-real/"">all that bullshit I talked about here.</a>

It’s going to be a great day. I feel rested. We have a collaboration brew day at the brewery with Holy City and I’ve blocked off some time from Push work to help and drink some beers. The kids are on their schedule and are actually sleeping until they are supposed to. Wow! Today is going to be a great day.

Then - Boom! I made a mistake I’ve been promising myself I would stop making. I checked my email. And there it was. A client was surfing the web at 2 a.m., saw an unforced error my team made (yes, it happens) and shot across a heat missile for me to wake up to. Missile launched. Missile hit. Boom! Anxiety levels are now through the freaking roof. My mood went from great to horrible. I snapped at both Elizabeth and Harlowe. I sent heat rounds to two members of my staff. I slammed dishes while washing out the coffee pot. Harlowe watched me and then slammed something because, of course, everything Daddy does is perfect and must be replicated. Shit! Here we are again.

I told you that I would tell you the true story of entrepreneurship. Here it is. You work your ass off to train up your staff, but they still screw up. You know, because they’re human beings and not robots. Your clients get pissed and send you emails at two o’clock in the morning. You wake up to said emails and get in a bad mood. You take it out on your family and staff.

I don’t want to get into the whole “staff screwing up” thing right now because that deserves a separate blog post. In fact, I’ve already written it. <a href=""http://wesleydonehue.com/call-individuals-staff-drop-balls/"">Read here</a>.But there are a lot of lessons to be learned from my crappy morning.
<div class=""_2cuy _3dgx"" data-block=""true"" data-editor=""dq1gc"" data-offset-key=""9d6ka-0-0"">
<div class=""_1mf _1mj"" data-offset-key=""9d6ka-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""9d6ka-0-0"">Here they are:</span></div>
</div>
<strong>1. Never check your email first thing in the morning,</strong> especially if you are on a schedule like mine, where you go to bed and wake up well before the rest of the world. That means other folks are still “working” and sending emails, so you’re going to wake up to a lot more emails than some folks. And those emails will absolutely dictate your mood for the day.

<strong>2. Social media, direct messages and text messages can wait.</strong> Most of that will be drama or bullshit too. Let the morning be about your own mental and physical health.

<strong>3. Meditate first thing in the morning.</strong> Get your mind right so that you are trained up and ready to deal with these situations. Yes, you must train your mind just like you train your body. I did not meditate before checking my email.

<strong>4. Before meditating, write in your journal.</strong> Spend ten minutes with an actual pen and paper - not a computer. Write out exactly what you want to accomplish today. Write out why you are <em>#blessed</em>. Tell yourself why life is effing badass and let that be what you think about as you’re preparing for the rest of the day, instead of dwelling all the bullshit and drama. You guessed it, I didn’t journal this morning before checking my email.

<strong>5. The morning is for exercise.</strong> The afternoon is for happy hour. That sums it up well, but I'll write completely separate about this soon.

1311,"This Is Why There Are So Many Positive Vibes Around Push","Last Friday was rough at Push. Everyone was stressed. We walked into our senior staff meeting and almost everyone bitched each other out. I walked out early. The senior leaders took their negativity out of the conference room and into their departments, where the bad moods trickled down to every other teammate.

Creativity was lost. Productivity was diminished. Everyone was looking forward to five o’clock.

It was a rough week. We woke up every morning to one client ripping us apart. A couple of our largest clients put us under insane deadlines. That's all good. That's typically when our team performs the best. But it's been a string of weeks like this, and at a certain point, the human mind just burns out. I was particularly burnt out, and instead of being a motivator, I let my team down by letting negative vibes permeate throughout the company. I went to bed Friday feeling like shit. I felt like shit all day Saturday. I proceeded to take my bad mood out on my F3 brothers at two big events, and then I took it out on my family.

It all changed when I woke up Sunday morning to an email from one of our senior teammates that was full of drama. I sat through church, seething. I'm not even sure what our pastor preached on. I couldn't think of one thing except how pissed off I was.

Suddenly, something flipped in my mind the moment I sat back down after communion. Maybe it was God. Maybe it was the taste of wine on my lips. Maybe it was me thinking about a F3 brother, who I had never met and who lost his life last week at the age of 37 after being hit by a car during a run, leaving behind a wife and two children. I asked myself, ""Wesley, why did you start Push?"" I knew the answer - to escape the negative vibes from my previous employer.

I wanted to have fun, because I believe creativity comes when you are in one of two places. You're either so depressed that you're hopped up on drugs or fueled by alcohol, eventually killing yourself like we've seen throughout history, <em>or</em> you're happy as hell and having fun. I think I'll choose the latter.
<p style=""text-align: left;"">I got home and immediately called my top three lieutenants. I then called our ad director. I told them all that when we step into the office on Monday, we will do nothing but radiate positive vibes throughout the walls of Push. Negativity and drama will not be tolerated. Negative people will be pulled aside, and maybe even sent home. The senior leaders will hold each other accountable and call each other out the moment negativity is spotted. We will fuel our creativity, our successes and our growth through positive vibes. Push will be built on positive vibes or I'll shut the whole thing down. I've learned from both my parents and my stepfather dying at very early ages that life is too short to let negativity dominate the mind. It's all positive vibes from here on out. I went around the office all day and all week just saying, ""positive vibes"" to reinforce the theme. Don't believe me? Here's proof:</p>

1327,"How To Work Out Four Hours A Day ","<p class=""graf graf--p""><em class=""markup--em markup--p-em"">Or Find More Time To Do Whatever You Want To Do</em></p>
Last week, I used Snapchat Stories to show a nearly complete view of my day, which consisted of four full hours of workout time. I lifted at the gym for an hour, meditated (mental training is vital for endurance events), stretched, did some breathing exercises and, completed an additional hour of core exercise. I swam for an hour during my “lunch break.” And then, before bed, I biked for an hour.

I was surprised by how many folks asked how I am able to fit that much workout time into a single day. One colleague even asked, “Do you actually work?” HA! Yeah, I feel like that’s all I ever do. When you’re the boss, work is the only thing on your mind, so even when you’re not working, you’re working. Anyway, I figured I’d answer them all at one time with this blog post.

Here are five actionable steps you can take right now to make your day much more efficient:

<strong>Step 1: Realize there are 24 hours in a day (and stop watching so much damn TV).</strong>

Everyone has the same amount of time in their day, but most folks haven’t wrapped their minds around what that really means. Let’s break it down.

Let’s say you sleep eight hours a night. I’ll harp on this for a minute because this is the place most folks try to find extra time. I’m not one of those people who touts about how little I sleep, as if sleeping for four hours a night is a key metric to success. Sleep is vital for mental energy and to recover from workouts. This is when the body and the mind repairs themselves. Sleep less and you may get more done in the short term, but you will eventually reach exhaustion and waste even more time on the backend. Trust me, I’ve been there.

Then let’s say you work nine hours a day. Let’s throw in an hour for shower time and day prep and then another hour for commuting. You still have five hours in your day for cooking, eating, drinking at the bar or hanging out with your kids. But I’m going to guess you are spending at least three of those hours binging Netflix.

Five hours is a lot of damn hours, folks. Even if you aren’t going to the extreme like me, you can find at least one hour to work out or to concentrate on whichever hobby you choose.

<strong>Step 2: Base your day on longterm goals.</strong>

Every hour in my day is based on a longterm goal. If you’ve read my previous material, you know I’m big on setting goals. You can read more <a href=""http://wesleydonehue.com/journey-become-ironman-begins-now/"">here</a> and <a href=""http://wesleydonehue.com/how-do-you-have-so-much-time/"">here</a>. Because I’ve written so extensively on this, I’m going to just summarize it here.

1. Write down your long term goals.
2. Write down your year-long goals that will help you get to #1 (also called resolutions).
3. Break those year goals down into quarterly goals.
4. Break those quarterly goals down into monthly goals.
5. Break those monthly goals into actionable weekly to-dos.
6. Break those weekly actionable to dos into daily actionable to-dos.
7. Base your entire day around those daily actionable to-dos.
8. Track every single day and evaluate monthly, making course corrections as needed.

This formula will ensure that you aren’t just sitting at your desk surfing the internet. Your eye must always remain on the goals that you have set. But it goes deeper…

<strong>Step 3: Focus on your five buckets.</strong>

This is a new step I’ve taken in the last month, which was passed on to me by my super successful friends Mark and Dr. Sarah Losby. They are blowing up a chiropractic empire in Columbia, SC. Step 2 explains what should be on your plate. Your five buckets tell you what shouldn’t be on your plate.

The brain can’t focus on too many things at one time. Most people don’t knock large goals out of the park because they are focusing on too much. You should focus on the most important goals in your life by identifying five areas, and five areas only, on which you will concentrate for the year. If anything comes on your plate that does not fall into one of those five buckets, eliminate it. If I can’t straight up do that, I follow Tim Ferriss’ formula explained in <a href=""http://fourhourworkweek.com/"">The Four Hour Work Week</a>:

1. Eliminate: Does this item need to be handled at all? If not, eliminate it.
2. Simplify: If it can’t be eliminated, how can it be simplified to take up much less time?
3. Automate: If it can’t be simplified, how can it be automated through technology so I don’t have to touch it?
4. Delegate: If it can’t be automated, how can I delegate it to another person?

I have my five buckets printed and hanging in my closet, and posted as my iPhone and iPad background to ensure that they are always in my face. I’m sure by now you are wondering what my five buckets are. I’ll leave that for a separate blog post.

By the way, five is not a magical number. Find what works best for you.

<strong>Step 4: Schedule every minute of your day.</strong>

Literally. Every minute of my day is booked on my calendar two weeks in advance. Every. Single. Minute. From the time I wake up to the time I go to bed. Every minute is based on my daily to dos and my five buckets. My assistant, Sally, knows exactly what my goals are and she makes sure that my day is focused on making those goals happen. She also knows that if an item doesn’t fall into one of my five buckets, then it shouldn’t make it to my calendar at all.

No other single step on this list is as important as this one. Without my day being booked solid, I will start surfing the web, get sucked into some political fight on Facebook, and then just start wasting minutes that could be used doing pull-ups or learning how to swim two miles. Or even more importantly, hanging out with my family.

<strong>Step 5: Multitask when possible.</strong>

I wrote in Step 3 that the brain can’t focus on too many items at one time. Studies have proven that the brain is not a multitasking machine. However, there are plenty of minutes in the day where we can find additional time by doing two tasks at one time and neither task is hurt by performing an additional task. For example, I “read” more books than most folks by listening to audiobooks while commuting and running. I commute at least an hour and a half every weekday. I also run at least seven hours a week. That gives me about 14 hours every week to listen to audiobooks. Here's another hack: listen on 2x speed.

Additionally, schedule all that conference call time during your drive. That alone can save you a couple of hours a day.

Now, you have no excuse. You do have time to workout, spend more time with your kids or start that side business you've been talking about for years.","Or find extra time to do whatever the hell you're passionate about.",2017-07-03,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/workout-four-hours-day/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/How-To-Maximize-Your-Day.png,"How To Work Out Four Hours A Day ","How To Maximize Your Day",,"How To Maximize Your Day",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/How-To-Maximize-Your-Day.png,,Blog|Fitness,"every day|Fitness|four|hours|how to|time management|workout",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,workout-four-hours-day,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
1334,"What Corporations Should Learn from Political Campaigns","I got my first political campaign job when I was 15 years old. Now, 22 years later, campaigns are still my passion. But at Push, we’re picking up more and more corporate work. And it’s coming from businesses that realize they need a thrifty political shop instead of a big New York ad agency that's just back from partying hard at Cannes. And the more corporate work we do, the more I realize just how much these big businesses need our skills, our experience, and most of all - our mentality.

<strong>Here are 10 things corporations should learn from political campaigns:</strong>

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">1. Speed is everything.</span>

There is only one commodity in politics: Time. You can raise more money. You can recruit more volunteers. But Election Day is coming fast and you don’t own an EFFing time machine. That’s why campaigns move at lightning speed. Corporations should, too. In the age of the internet and 24-hour news networks, public opinion can shift in 20 minutes and it could take you months to fight back. You have to move now. Not tomorrow. Now.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2. Make every penny count.</span>

Money is the 2nd most precious commodity in politics. It’s why campaign managers are so cheap. Campaigns are the only endeavor where millions of dollars are raised, only to be completely spent in a 4-6 week period. That’s why campaign managers are such cheap motherf**kers. The good ones are making things work on fumes until it’s time to spend. You’re held accountable for every single dollar you spend. It’s public. So spend carefully, strategically and wisely.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">3. It’s all about getting shit done.</span>

It’s not about meetings or conference calls. Corporations talk themselves in circles. Campaigns need results ASAP.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">4. Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.</span></span>

Campaign managers ask one question: Will this action get me closer to winning or not? If it gets you closer to your goal, it’s good enough. That’s it. No need to overthink or overproduce.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">5. Simplify the decision-making process.</span>

If you need a PowerPoint presentation to explain it, then it’s too complicated. You must have people around you who are empowered to make decisions. Too many cooks in the kitchen will kill your speed and flexibility, and may even grind you to a halt.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">6. Always be ready to take a hit.</span>

Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. So plan on being punched in the face.

Seriously. Your competition. The public. News. You can’t be sure when, or from which direction, but you can be sure it’s coming.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">7. Every crisis is an opportunity.</span>

Never go on the defensive.

But do: Have a nimble team in place. Get out in front of the crisis. Be strong, resolute, clear. Bend, but don’t break. Be cool under pressure. Be the person with a plan. Always be ready to pivot and counterpunch.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">8. Build armies of advocates - not just customers.</span>

The best campaigns are about people, and they become “movements.” Advocates and supporters are cultivated carefully and patiently over the course of a campaign. They need to be treated as the last match in a windstorm. Every customer is a potential soldier when the enemy comes knocking at your door.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">9. Don’t overlook niche audiences.</span>

Conservative grandmothers. Rural tweens. Every vote counts.

Now that audiences can be broken down, targeted and reached more specifically, be open to the possibilities some niche audiences may bring your way. Some group you might never have considered could be the key to an amazing new market.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">10. You need 51% market share.</span>

Market share is important. For instance, 10% market share in a given industry could mean millions or billions of dollars. Ha! 10% in politics means you lost… you go home… you blew it. Political market share means you have to go big and think big. Campaign managers are constantly asking the question; “How do I get to 51%?”

Over the next ten days, we will be diving deep into each of these points. This’ll be good stuff.","We're pushing past those big New York firms one corporate client at a time.",2017-07-05,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/corporations-learn-political-campaigns/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170705_Push_Corporations_FBLink.jpg,"What Corporations Should Learn from Political Campaigns","What corporations should learn from political campaigns",,"What corporations should learn from political campaigns",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170705_Push_Corporations_FBLink.jpg,,Blog,"10 things|Campaigns|corporations|learn|political",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,corporations-learn-political-campaigns,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
1348,"What Corporations Should Learn from Political Campaigns: Speed","<a href=""http://wesleydonehue.com/corporations-learn-political-campaigns/"">This is Part 1 of a 10 part series.</a>

As PUSH takes on more corporate clients, one thing I’ve noticed is the pace at which companies move… it’s slow. They talk and deliberate, and talk some more. And they never really seem to make a move.

It might just be me though… because after 20 years in politics, I’ve learned to move fast and it’s engrained in PUSH’s DNA to act with a sense of urgency on every project.

The Reason: There is only ONE commodity in politics - TIME. You can raise more money. You can recruit more volunteers. You can’t create more time. There is an election date set and it’s not moving!

I’ve been living in a world where there’s ONLY urgency. End-of-the-quarter fundraising. Primary. Debate. Press conference. Editorial review board. Absentee Ballots. The calendar is moving against you at every step. Speed is your only option.
<blockquote>Corporations need to take a page from the political play book and move fast. Here’s why: In the age of the Internet and 24-hour news networks, public opinion can shift in 20 minutes.</blockquote>
Case in point: United Airlines’ public relations disaster in May took them DAYS to get response out. While they were making sure every corporate lawyer, public relations executive, and board member checked off on a statement - the internet was carving them a new one with memes, videos, tweets and blog posts.

Your lawyers may keep you out of jail, but they’re not going to save you from the online hoard of hecklers. And unfortunately - the slow down is doing more damage to your brand.

Swift action could have made the difference for United.

At Push, we approach corporate brand reputation with the same sense of urgency as a campaign. This doesn’t mean we’re sloppy. It doesn’t mean we haven’t thought things through… it just means your message reaches your audience faster and will have a greater impact.

As information moves quicker and more diffuse thanks to technology; Corporations should start thinking like campaigns and pick up the pace.","Speed is everything.",2017-07-07,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/corporations-learn-political-campaigns-part-1/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170707_Push_Graphic_Featured.jpg,"What Corporations Should Learn from Political Campaigns: Speed","speed is everything",,"speed is everything",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170707_Push_Graphic_Featured.jpg,,Blog,"Campaigns|corporations|learn|lessons|marketing|push digital|speed",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,corporations-learn-political-campaigns-part-1,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

I didn't die in my very first triathlon. But I thought I was going to three times. I'm not joking or over exaggerating. I can honestly say I haven't been that scared since I was held up with a sawed off shotgun to my head, while working at Applebees. Three times the lifeguards came over and asked if I was okay. Even Old Flame stopped mid-swim to ask if I was okay.

About 20 seconds in, a guy grabbed the top of my shorts and pulled me under water. I took a huge gulp of water and came up freaking out. I swam immediately to shore. I never mentally recovered.

It was bad, y'all. I'd say it was the most embarrassing moment of my life, especially when I was breast stroking to shore, fighting for air and trying to reach the bottom, while my family was right there watching. I choked up and almost cried. So bad. So very embarrassing.

I walked the last 25ish meters with my head hung in shame. I prayed no one was watching as I ripped off my cap and goggles with anger. But everyone was watching. No claps. No encouraging words. Just looks of astonishment as if they had just witnessed a legitimate train wreck.

The bike portion went as expected. I held a 18 - 19 mph pace and was satisfied with my performance. I just need to get over my mind EFF from the big crash a few months back. Physically I can push harder. I'm just scared I'll crash hard. Only time will fix this issue.

The run went well. I held a solid 7:40 pace. The heat got me a few times and I walked more than I wanted, but still, I felt that I crushed it. I finished strong and passed a lot of people who passed me in the water.

All in all, it was a negative experience. But shit, I can't go anywhere but up from here. Many thanks to my amazing swim coach, Chris. Without him I wouldn't have finished at all. Thanks to my F3 brothers and all you internet peeps who encouraged me. Most of all, thanks to my smoking hot wife and two boys who came out to encourage me.

I might suck big time, but this man has no quit in him. DFQ mofos! On to my next two sprints, an Olympic distance and a half Ironman. If you need me in the next 16 weeks I'll probably be at Danny Jones pool.","But it was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life.",2017-07-10,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/didnt-die-first-triathlon/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170516_Push_WesleyBlog_964x482.jpg,"I Didn't Die In My First Triathlon","my first triathlon",,"my first triathlon",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170516_Push_WesleyBlog_964x482.jpg,,Blog|Fitness,AAR|first|ironman|journey|triathlon|wesley,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,didnt-die-first-triathlon,video,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

<em>Money is the second most precious commodity in politics.</em>

You hear the old cliche ""government should be run like a business.""  Naw man. Government should be run like something a little closer to home - a political campaign. And for that matter, so should businesses. It's all about running the most efficient machine achievable where every dollar spent is scrutinized down to the penny on a daily basis. It's about being lean and mean.

Campaigns are the only endeavor where MILLIONS of dollars are raised, only to be completely spent in an extremely short time period. That’s why campaign managers are so tight with money. They have to be. The good ones can make things run on fumes until it’s time to spend.
<blockquote>Campaigns are held accountable for every single dollar spent. It’s public. It’s reported. Normal businesses don’t have that kind of microscope on them—or that sort of bust-to-boom-to-bust budget cycle. But businesses can learn from this.</blockquote>
Money is a finite resource. Spend it that way. Whether you are running IBM or something small like my brewery, demand regular reporting and metrics. You HAVE to be able to modify tactics or targets quickly. Of course, I am talking mostly here about advertising spending—but “make every penny count” is a good North Star whether you’re buying a tractor or a forest; not just ads.

<em><strong>In politics there's no room for the bullshit waste you see in the corporate world. No fancy offices. No huge consultant markups. No inflated salaries. Sure, folks make money, but they make money by showing rock solid results. No results, no cash. It's that simple.</strong></em>

On every political campaign we handle we provide a weekly or bi-weekly report showing every single dollar spent with an analysis of what that dollar produced. Every. Single. Dollar. Hell, sometimes those reports are daily, especially after large events such as televised debates or toward the end of the campaign. If a dollar doesn't produce a desired result in a specific timeline, it gets cut or reallocated. From my experience working with corporate clients, spending can go on and on and on for months without someone really looking into the numbers. It's effing mind blowing.

In the digital space, we get learnings quickly and make adjustments quickly. It’s all about ROI. For us that’s cost per acquisition—how much per click, how much per email, how much per view, how much per dollar.

For your business it could be any number of things but the question is the same: what am I getting for each dollar spent? And then, how much more could or should I get, and what do I need to do differently to optimize my spending?","Make every penny count.",2017-07-10,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/corporations-learn-political-campaigns-part-2/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170710_Push_EveryPenny_FI.jpg,"What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: Be Lean and Mean","Make every penny count.",,"Make every penny count.",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170710_Push_EveryPenny_FI.jpg,,Blog,campaign|corporations|count|learn|lessons|money|penny|political,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,corporations-learn-political-campaigns-part-2,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

<em>It's all about getting shit done.</em>

One thing I learned early on working in politics is the importance of task completion. I came into this already a hard worker (at age 15) but politics is an entirely different animal. From putting up yard signs to getting bumper stickers from the printer to calling TV stations, it was go-go-go and do-do-do every day. And no one wants to hear your stories about why something is half-done or late or the dog ate the latest poll results.

It’s, “Did you get it done?” Yes or no. Businesses, take note:
<blockquote>It’s not about meetings or conference calls. Yes, some are necessary. But what counts is ACTUALLY GETTING THINGS DONE. Writing and sending a fundraising email. Shooting, editing and posting a video. I’m a scheduler, as many of you know. The most precious commodity each of us has is time. And I don’t want to spend mine in endless meetings. I want to spend my time DOING, not talking abut doing.</blockquote>
I also want an agenda and a follow-up report. Everything is about action. What needs to be done and who’s doing it.

What I have observed is that corporations talk themselves in circles. Meeting after meeting after meeting, and the weekly meeting talking about last week’s meeting and then the next… I get it. It’s more complex in business, especially in bigger companies.

But campaigns need results ASAP. And businesses should expect no less. I can tell you this—corporate clients get no less from us. 37-year-old Wesley is like 15-year-old Wesley—I get things done. And so does my firm.

We’re not staffed with t-crossers and i-dotters. And your company shouldn’t be full of them. Surround yourself with people you can count on to get their hands dirty and GET THINGS DONE.

If you’re a meeting planner, have meetings. I named my agency Push instead of Sit On Your Ass because we get…see the trend here? We get things done.

That has to be the focus.","Who has time for meetings about meetings?",2017-07-11,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/corporations-learn-political-campaigns-get-shit-done/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170516_push_Part3_964x482.jpg,"What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: Get Shit Done","get shit done",,"get shit done",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170516_push_Part3_964x482.jpg,,Blog,"corporations|done|get shit done|learn|political campaigns",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,corporations-learn-political-campaigns-get-shit-done,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

<em>Don’t Let Perfect Be the Enemy of Good</em>

I learned a lot, and quickly, when I started working on political campaigns. This was pre-digital Wesley but I was an analog perfectionist. Got cured of that fast. You can keep re-editing a TV spot, rewriting a speech, redesigning a direct mail piece; and three weeks after the election announce that it’s perfect.

Too late.

Not every single thing you’re working on is destined to become the Mona Lisa or the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. That doesn’t mean you should do things poorly. I’ve trained myself over the years—and my staff is talented enough—to do work well, strategically and quickly.

Businesses can learn from this:
<blockquote>Campaign managers ask one question: Will this action get me closer to winning, or not? If it gets you closer to your goal, it’s good enough. That’s it. No need to overthink or overproduce.</blockquote>
In your business, you encounter these same decisions daily. Hourly maybe. Your gut should tell you, or your direct reports should, or research or something should—that it’s time to approve this and move on. Budget, plan for entering a new market, product or package design, meeting materials;  if you have solid people working with you and there is a solid reason for a project in the first place, trust them and yourself enough to say, “Go.""

Yes, there are certain things you <i>need</i> to spend an overabundance of time on—could be a merger or acquisition, the location of a new facility, a regulatory filing or anything involving lawyers (sorry!). Fair enough. You know the difference. Remember the campaign manager question above, applied to business:  will this action get me closer to my goal, or not? If yes, then it’s good.

Your time is also worth money.  If you’re spending it reviewing Revision #58, something’s wrong. In the words of my trusted confidant Jonathan Williams:  Fix it.

And in 2017, you don't have the <i>luxury</i> of being a perfectionist. Speed doesn't permit it. News, social platforms all just move too fast...public opinion can be set while you're trying to make shit perfect. So don't.","Don’t let perfect be the enemy of the good.",2017-07-12,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/corporations-campaigns-learn-perfection-overrated/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170712_Push_BlogGraphic_FB_Featured.jpg,"What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: Perfection Is Overrated","What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: Perfection Is Overrated",,"What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: Perfection Is Overrated",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170712_Push_BlogGraphic_FB_Featured.jpg,,Blog,"corporations|learn|overrated|perfect|perfection|political camapigns",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,corporations-campaigns-learn-perfection-overrated,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

<em>Simplify the decision making process.</em>

The first time I lived under a dictatorship was when I started working on political campaigns. Seriously. It’s not unclear who makes decisions on a political campaign. It’s the Campaign Manager. End of story. No committee. No “we’ll get back to you.” Just yes, no and sometimes #@*&amp;%!

Now we work with a lot of bigger corporate clients and I enjoy it immensely. But if they could take one page from the campaign playbook, it would be this:
<blockquote>The digital space moves fast. Push moves fast. Bigger companies move, well…more deliberately. And ultimately all of that is a product of the decision-making process. “We’ll let you know after we hear back from [pick one or more] legal/the field/sales/PR/marketing/the board/our bosses/their boss.”</blockquote>
I understand “due diligence.” But we are not trying to invade other countries—just your Facebook feed! There has to be a better way. A faster way.

Because while we are waiting to “hear back,” the marketplace is still moving and so are your competitors. Solid lesson from the campaign trail—your opponent doesn’t stand by waiting as you deliberate. This isn’t chess.

Think about where you work: If you need a PowerPoint presentation to explain the decision-making process, then it’s too damn complicated. Especially for shorter-term projects, lower dollar amounts, thoroughly vetted projects, you simply MUST have people around you who are empowered to make decisions.

Two things to watch out for—one, people who CAN’T make decisions. Every organization has some. The person with ten hands. “On the one hand, but on the other hand…” Have that person responsible for things that aren’t decisions.

And, two—take this from someone who worked in the restaurant industry—the old adage is 100% true: Too many cooks in the kitchen will kill your speed and flexibility, and may even grind you to a halt.

Ultimately of course, your company will have one primary decision maker. Regardless of size, the buck stops somewhere. Like the Campaign Manager for the candidate, this job is bigger picture—where are we going, how are we getting there, what is the plan?

Speed, flexibility, data, goals, decisions—that’s a road map for victory right there.","Simplify the decision making process.",2017-07-13,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/corporations-learn-political-campaigns-empower-people/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170713_Push_Decision_FI.jpg,"What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: Empower Your People","What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: Empower Your People",,"What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: Empower Your People",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170713_Push_Decision_FI.jpg,,Blog,Campaigns|corporations|empower|learn|people,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,corporations-learn-political-campaigns-empower-people,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

<em>Always be ready to take a hit.</em>

A lot of people who don’t work in politics ask me if I have  ever been around any scandals or big, negative, national news stories. The short answer is “yes.” The longer answer is ""you wouldn’t believe half of them if I told you.""

But here’s what I've  learned from being around when something hits the fan in politics. And businesses need to learn this also:
<blockquote>Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. So plan on being punched in the face.</blockquote>
Learning to manage a crisis, is something I learned early in my campaign life. See, in politics, candidates don't live in a vacuum - they're compared and contrasted to other candidates in the race. This inevitably leads to negative campaigning and constantly being a target. Political opponents will turn ANYTHING into a negative story about you. The old joke is if you walked on water, the opposition would say you don’t know how to swim.

On the campaign trail...  you're gonna get hit and you'll have to respond quickly. Companies could learn a thing or two on this front. Your competition. The public. News. You can’t be sure when, or from which direction, but you can be sure it’s coming.

Your business could be sued, could be offered enticements to relocate, could get a “big” government contract, have layoffs, have a workplace accident—see where I’m going? Someone has a problem with it and then it’s news and then—guess what?  Yep. You just got punched in the face.

Step one. Get all the facts. In politics, we keep research books on every candidate in the race for just an occasion. (Even research on yourself). Knowing all the angles will help you respond and make sure you have the best plan when a crisis happens.

Step two. Have a plan in place before a crisis happens. Wargame a step by step plan for managing the crisis. Know what your ""generalized"" response and tone will be. Know who will respond on behalf of your company. Know what steps you'll take to correct the issue.

When you get hit, it's best to be ready and have a plan to stop the bleeding.","It's inevitable.

1408,"What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: Crisis = Opportunity","By Phil Vangelakos

<a href=""http://wesleydonehue.com/corporations-learn-political-campaigns/"">This is part 7 of a 10 part series.</a>

<em>Every crisis is an opportunity.</em>

During President Barack Obama’s first term, his then-Chief of Staff, Rahm Emmanuel, was noted for operating by the mantra “Never waste a crisis.” A hard-nosed political operative and former Congressman himself, Emmanuel knew exactly what anyone living in the campaign space understands— bad situations can create <em>fantastic</em> opportunities.

As Push Digital takes on more and more corporate clients—I’ve noticed business become paralyzed in situations that campaigns see as par-for-the course. Likewise, rather than capitalize on the attention in a positive way, corporations tend to cower and retreat.

So what’s the difference? Why do campaigns react one way and corporations another?

Here’s the key: Campaigns can see beyond current events and keep their eye on the prize, election day. Therefore, a good campaign manager will see the significant opportunities that await beyond the crisis… and maybe because of the crisis.

Here are a couple ways that your business can capitalize on a downturn or tough situation like a political operative.

<strong>Stay alive. Come together.</strong>

As a campaign manager, I’ve had to talk candidates and staff off a ledge when things looked bleak.

Often, I’ve said things like… “This will blow over” or “It’s a one-day story” or “We’re not dead yet.” Of course I was lying. Sh*t went haywire. But in my mind, I was looking to keep everyone calm, and find a “plateau” where a safe basecamp could be forged during the storm. Sure, our progress up the mountain had been halted, but the expedition continues. My priority was always to stay alive and bring the team together.

Crisis can create solidarity in an organization. Let this horrible situation make your team more cohesive, more committed and more trustworthy in your leadership. Once you’ve gone through the storm… you’ll have a stronger better campaign.

<strong>Find the opportunity.</strong>

Sometimes the forest needs to burn down for new growth to flourish.

On campaigns, there's a lot to be said about the “path to victory.” Simply put, it’s “how we win.” When crisis hits, you need to reevaluate your path to victory. Things have changed. The plan needs to change. When bad things happen, I ask myself, “What’s the easiest path forward now that things have crumbled? Is there a better path now that I know the facts?”

Ask yourself some questions.

Does this crisis allow you to shift your market? Shift your position in the market? Create a greater brand loyalty among your faithful customers? Can we reposition funds to better serve our new position? Should we redeploy or reallocate our personnel more efficiently? Is this a good time to promote individuals who shined during the crisis?

Inevitably, these questions will lead to answers you couldn't have seen before the crisis and better position you for fights to come.

<strong>Strike Back</strong>
“F^%k those m*therf^&amp;@ers.”

This is basically the internal monologue of anyone who’s successfully managed a campaign through a crisis. Campaigns are war. You may have lost a battle, but now you’re stronger, you’re repositioned and now it’s time to fight back.

Practically though, ask yourself the question: Can I use this crisis to throw our competition off their game?

Maybe your competition has similar weaknesses to you before the crisis. Exploit them.

Maybe your competition used nefarious means or shady practices to take you down. Expose them.

Maybe your competition underestimates your ability to out maneuver them because of the crisis. Undercut them.

Congrats. You’re now the underdog. And people LOVE a good fight. If you can’t find a way to strike back post-crisis, you’ve wasted a grand opportunity.",,2017-07-18,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/corporations-learn-political-campaigns-crisis-equals-opportunity/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170516_Push_CorpImagePart7_964x482.jpg,"What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: Crisis = Opportunity","crisis = opportunity",,"crisis = opportunity",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170516_Push_CorpImagePart7_964x482.jpg,,Blog,"corporations|crisis|learn|opportunity|political campaigns",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,corporations-learn-political-campaigns-crisis-equals-opportunity,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

1418,"What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: Customers Care","This is part 8 of a 10 part series.

<a href=""http://wesleydonehue.com/corporations-learn-political-campaigns/""><em>Build armies of advocates - not just customers.</em></a>

Do we all want friends? Of course we do. But good friends—real friends—are the ones you can call no matter what and no matter when to get you out of a jam or help you carry something heavy up stairs. That’s what you want on campaigns, and that should be what you want for your business:

For one thing, you have to admit—the idea of having your own army is kind of sexy right there. But working on political campaigns, you primarily are looking for voters. Duh—I know; but every call, every parade, every bumper sticker is meant to get more voters on your side. Lots more voters.

But what you really want are advocates. Ambassadors. Apostles. On a campaign, they make the calls, deliver the yard signs, send friend-of-friend cards, write letters to the editor.

That’s also what you want in business. Not just customers—brand advocates. People who write reviews. Blog. Snap. Post photos. Tell friends. And here’s what you can do:
<blockquote>Make it worth their while and encourage them to do more.</blockquote>
Whatever the budget allows for honest and true-to-the-brand swag or incentive, do it. Respond to them. Follow them. Laugh at their jokes if they’re funny. As you would with friends.

No stalking. No artificial BS. And no bots. No clogging their inboxes. Pay attention to what they say and take their input when offered. Or ask them for opinions. Use them as a sounding board. Recognize them.

Do what fits with what you do. An upgrade, Free shipping. A preview. A gift card. An autograph. An invitation to an event.

It doesn’t even have to be a thing. It could be an acknowledgement. A thank you.

There is northing more valuable than “friends of the movement.” They need to be cultivated as carefully as your last match in a wind storm.

The evidence in support of this is overwhelming. So are the metrics. Brand advocates are more likely to share positive experiences. That’s more likely to turn into more sales, at likely a lower acquisition cost—because it came through an unpaid sales force.

Creating and nurturing brand advocates can yield a lot of good things for your company, including a shit-ton of money.

<em>Don't overlook niche audiences.</em>

When I’m running a political campaign, who’s my audience? Voters. And whether you are working on advertising for Coca-Cola or the corner store, the question is the same:  who’s my audience? The next question is: what’s the best way to reach them?

At one time, the primary way was through broad-reach media, like network television or radio. That’s all changed. Now, we can break down audiences to target and reach them much more specifically and efficiently. That’s a HUGE improvement. So NOW the question really is: which audience segment(s) am I trying to reach? And here’s a suggestion:

There is safety in numbers, right? So, using polling data in a political campaign or getting demographic info for a national retail brand, the temptation is to go where the most numbers are. Makes sense? Here’s the thing— some group you might have NEVER considered could be the key to success.

So don’t just look at the numbers. Maybe you’ll find a group that can be more receptive to your message, or is more likely to take action (like vote, or try a new product). Besides the hard facts, use your gut. Soccer Moms? Millennials? Conservative grandmothers? Rural tweens?

If you like poring over data (like me), you’ll LOVE how targeted you can be. And unlike election seasons, when some people (and, boy, does this drive me nuts) won’t vote unless it’s a presidential year—most people are hungry and thirsty and ready to buy home improvements or jeans or something pretty much every day. So you can test and learn.

Look at the numbers but not ONLY the numbers. Keep your eyes open. Dig. But trust your intuition. And don’t drive yourself nuts trying to find brown-eyed, suburban, dual-income households with beagles. (Even though you can.)","Don't overlook niche audiences.",2017-07-20,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/what-corporations-should-learn-from-political-campaigns-play-niche/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170516_Push_CorpPart9_964x482.jpg,"What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: Play Niche","What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: Play Niche",,"What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: Play Niche",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170516_Push_CorpPart9_964x482.jpg,,Blog,"audience|corporationa|learn|niche|political campaigns",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,what-corporations-should-learn-from-political-campaigns-play-niche,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

<em>You need 51% market share. </em>

Market share is important. For instance, 10% market share in a given industry could mean millions or billions of dollars.

Ha! 10% in politics means you lost… you go home… you blew it. Buh bye. Political market share means you have to go big and think even bigger. Campaign managers are constantly asking the question, “How do I get to 51%?

In politics, one more vote than your opponent is the goal. Sure—a landslide would be great. But generally we just want the “W.”

In business, the question really is “How do I surpass my competitors?” And the answer comes from not just looking at market share but also mind share. What do people think of your brand? How much do they know about it? How does your brand stack up to the competition? What are your brand’s (and your competitors’) strengths and weaknesses? Where and how are our best chances to grow ?

OK, so now how can you beat them? Can you beat your competitors with a new product or packaging? Can you beat them to a new distribution channel? Can you beat them on price? Service? Quality?

You don’t want to just be “competitive.” There has to be a desire within the company at the highest levels to WIN.

My advice is to strive for and stake out a leadership position. Biggest in town. Fastest-growing in the US. Most profitable in the industry. Maybe you can even win a Best Places to Work designation. Just be on top somewhere. And stop at nothing to get there.

Put your focus on success and opportunity. On winning. Take it from the political guy—it pays to be a winner.","You need 51% market share.",2017-07-21,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/corporations-learn-political-campaigns-pays-winner/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170516_Push_CorpPart10_964x482.jpg,"What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: It Pays To Be A Winner.","What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: It Pays To Be A Winner.",,"What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns: It Pays To Be A Winner.",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/170516_Push_CorpPart10_964x482.jpg,,Blog,"bigger|corporations|go big|learn|pays to win|political campaigns",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,corporations-learn-political-campaigns-pays-winner,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

1439,"My Failed Vlogging Experiment and WE'RE HIRING","Last week I launched a vlogging experiment to see if I could vlog six days in a row. I love blogging but video seems to suit me better for two reasons. First, I can do it quickly, on the fly and anywhere. Secondly, I believe a lot of the folks out there giving advice on the web our faking it. I see people giving business advice who have never even really built a business. With video I can show the proof behind the rhetoric.

Unfortunately the vlogging experiment failed miserably. The thought was that I could do the videoing myself and then pass the clips off to one of my editors. The first part went well as I cut six days of video. We released three and we still have three in the can. Unfortunately my video team is completely slammed with paying clients and they must come first. Thus, I’m the plumber with the leaky pipes or as some say, the cobbler whose kids have no shoes.

I enjoyed my six days of vlogging and I also want to live what I preach for my businesses Frothy Beard, Zombie Bob’s Pizza and Push. I tell our clients that they have to pump out constant content and today everything is going video. Thus, my businesses have to pump out constant videos.

The only way to get this done is to bring on my third full-time video editor to concentrate solely on my internal projects. So that’s what I’m doing. If you’re a badass videographer, <a href=""http://www.pushdigital.com/jobs/"">click here</a> and lets do some amazing work together.

1464,"Crisis Communications 101","Over the last several years, Push Digital has become known as THE crisis communications firm in the Southeast. Perhaps it’s because of the work we’ve done with big corporations or maybe it’s just our experience with the day-to-day rigamarole of the political campaign cycle. Whatever the reason is, all we know is that our team is really good at cleaning up messes and finding the silver lining for our clients.

So, what exactly is crisis communications? By definition it’s an unexpected or detrimental situation or event. Essentially, a crisis is any “Oh shit!” moment that you and your team may encounter. Whether you’re in the Charleston Lowcountry or in the skyscraper capital of the world… gravity is universally the same. And you know what rolls downhill. So you need to be prepared for the storm that follows.

In politics, crises happen a lot. And, more often than not, campaign managers face some sort of scandal almost every single day. That’s just politics. However, here’s the trick, every “good” campaign manager knows that if a crisis management plan is prepared and approached correctly, it can play to your advantage like a game. A really ugly and convoluted game where you’re either a winner or a loser—and nobody wants to be a loser. Sounds like fun, right?

How do you win the crisis communications game? Simple. Just follow the Push Digital 3-step plan…

<strong>1 Tell it all.</strong>

<strong>2 Tell it fast.</strong>

<strong>3 Tell the truth.</strong>

Over the next several weeks we’re going to explore WHAT our crisis communications strategy is, WHY our strategy should be your solution, and HOW you can implement it. So if you don’t have a pen and paper, go ahead and grab some because class is in session and you’re gonna to want to take notes.","Listen up and takes notes.

1468,"11 Dos And Don'ts Of Crisis Communications","Whether you’re in politics or business, crises are inevitable. That’s just a fact. Accidents and terrible situations are going to occur, but how you handle said situations could not be more crucial.

In politics, it’s common practice for campaign managers to have a plan in place just in case their candidate’s skeletons do decide to walk out of the closet. It enables them to react quickly. Businesses—big or small—also need this ability. However, we’ve discovered that this is often NOT the case. Corporations tend to cower and deliberate about what they should do for days, letting a story get worse or allowing their competitor to capitalize on their mistakes, when they should have been seizing the opportunity to pivot and create positive attention. But that’s a whole different blog. You can learn about what corporations should learn from political campaigns <a href=""http://www.pushdigital.com/corporations-learn-political-campaigns-crisis-equals-opportunity/"">here</a>.

So, what do you do if you find yourself in a crisis? Well, here’s what you should do: respond quickly, effectively, efficiently and in a sincere manner. Or you can follow the Push Digital 3 Step System:
<ol>
 	<li>Tell it all.</li>
 	<li>Tell it fast.</li>
 	<li>Tell the truth.</li>
</ol>
Believe it or not, following those 3 simple steps is more difficult than you would think. However, thanks to our work with larger corporations and our combined 50+ years of campaign experience, we’ve compiled a comprehensive list of dos and please-whatever-you-do-don’t-do-thats.

Here are 11 things we’ve learned to do and not to do:

<strong>1. OWN IT AND APOLOGIZE</strong>
Time is crucial, so respond quickly and admit the mistake. Then proceed to apologize, again and again....and again. Be sincere and simple in apologizing even if the absolute truth is more complicated and blame isn't singular.

<strong>2. DO THE RIGHT THING</strong>
Fix it fast. Make sure your audience knows how you plan to fix it and the timeline for completing. Being open and transparent here could not be more important. Don’t fake it till you make it because the internet trolls will know.

<strong>3. MOVE ON</strong>
Look for a pivot point to stop focusing on the problem and quickly get to the solution or back to business. The mistake happened, you owned up to it, and hopefully you’ve fixed it. The media storm will blow over, eventually.

<strong>4. REBUILD THE BRAND</strong>
Look for opportunities to prove you've corrected the crisis and reinforce your brand principles. Reward customer loyalty and give new customers a reason to do business.

<strong>5. KNOW THE BATTLEFIELD</strong>
The Internet is and will always be the battlefield. Every single day until forever. Things don’t just go away.

<strong>6. KNOW AND LABEL THE OPPONENT</strong>
Sometimes the real enemy isn’t clear to you or to the public. Make sure you know who you are fighting.

<strong>7. GET ALL THE FACTS</strong>
Don’t let one side get out their story on every news channel and be shared a million times without getting your side in the story. The Internet doesn’t wait for anyone.

<strong>8. TALK TO ATTORNEYS (SPARINGLY)</strong>
Attorneys are important to keep you out of jail, but they can also gum up the system and make it impossible for you to respond quick enough.

<strong>9. DON’T FEED THE TROLLS. BUT DO FEED THE BEAST.</strong>
You won’t make Internet trolls happy no matter how many questions you answer. The Internet demands content. More content. Fast contents. Lots and lots of content. Define yourself or someone else will.

<strong>10. MEASURE. ALWAYS. ALWAYS MEASURE.</strong>
Don’t go in blind. While you must respond quickly, get a poll in the field as fast as you can and base your decisions on real numbers.Then poll again. And again. Constantly measure online sentiment.

<strong>11. HAVE YOUR CRISIS TEAM IN PLACE BEFORE A CRISIS HAPPENS.</strong>

OWN IT AND APOLOGIZE.

Time is crucial, so respond quickly and admit the mistake. Then proceed to apologize, again and again….and again. Be sincere and simple in apologizing even if the absolute truth is more complicated and blame isn’t singular.

This is one of the most critical aspects of overcoming any crisis situation. It's also one of the hardest things to get people to execute on. We can look at any number of recent crisis situations to see an example of what not to do.

Take the United Airlines incident where a passenger was dragged off of an airplane in full view of iPhone wielding passengers. The airline's first reaction was to pretend there was no problem. Then when the internet did what it normally does in these situations, the CEO huddled with lawyers, and doubled down with righteous indignation.

At this point, most communications professionals could picture exactly what was happening - United's PR team was left sitting in the hallway pulling their hair out while all the executives and legal team decided that the best way forward was to never accept responsibility and to actually blame the passenger.

United was wrong in this specific example, and they were brought to the whipping post one day later. But generally speaking, the truth doesn't matter as much as perception. If the public perceives that your organization has done something wrong, then they are going to expect some sort of apology. It's best to just rip that bandaid off.

In crisis communications, you need a pivot point. You need something to get you off the back foot and onto the front foot. A quick and direct apology is the fastest way to get on with regular business. Suck it up, buttercup.

We all want to roast the unrepentant person, but the other side of that coin is that we all want to give people a second chance. Redemption is powerful.

So if you find yourself in a crisis situation, resist the natural instinct to explain away and avoid blame. Take responsibility and own it. It's the difference in prolonged pain and moving on.","Step one when shit hits the fan.",2017-08-07,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/crisis-communications-dos-donts-apologize/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/170802_Push_Graphic_Featured-2.jpg,"Crisis Communications Dos And Don'ts: Own It And Apologize","Crisis Communications Dos And Don'ts: Own It And Apologize",,"Crisis Communications Dos And Don'ts: Own It And Apologize",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/170802_Push_Graphic_Featured-2.jpg,,Blog,"apologize|communications|crisis|don'ts|dos|own up",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,crisis-communications-dos-donts-apologize,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

DO THE RIGHT THING

People make mistakes. Why? Because we’re human. And according to the United States Supreme Court, so are corporations.

Over the past several years the courts have been expanding and defining the rights of corporations. For example, corporations are now allowed to spend money on political campaigns, and they can even choose to refuse federal mandates because of religious views.

By definition, a corporation is a number of persons united in one body for a purpose. Does that bring clarity to the reason why companies often royally f*ck up? You betcha! When there’s an entity created and run by a bunch of humans, that entity is bound to make mistakes… and BIG ones.

No matter the size, even if you’re one single person or a corporation with millions of employees, morals can get messy and, for that, we have just one piece of advice: Do the right thing. Period.

Let’s look at the largest cyber security breach of all time. In 2014, Yahoo was hacked by a ""state-sponsored"" hacker who stole more than 500 million users' names, emails, phone numbers, and encrypted passwords. What Yahoo didn’t do… was TELL people for two whole years. Just last November, while negotiating an acquisition deal with Verizon, it was disclosed that several persons were aware of the breach in 2014, but had claimed they did not know the “true” extent of the hacker’s reach. Of course, and rightfully so, the $4.8 billion deal with Verizon is in limbo and Yahoo’s sales have plummeted.

Because the whole truth can be complex or multiple parties are to blame, senior leadership will often take cover in a mahogany room with their lawyers, searching for loopholes and wordsmithing the situation to save face. Think about it this way, when a brand’s reputation is at stake, it’s the same as a sole individual’s. You’re considered untrustworthy by your friends and that logo you paid a pretty penny for is tainted.

What senior leadership should be doing is telling the truth and attempting to correct the mistake ASAP. Lies will lead to more lies, so get your story straight (the real story) and fix it fast. Make sure your audience knows how you plan to fix it and the timeline for remedying it. Being honest and transparent will create a positive pivot point for your company. If you attempt to fake it ’til you make it, the internet trolls will find you and they will let everyone know. And no one wants that. Except for the trolls.

Do the right thing.","Or the trolls will find you.",2017-08-07,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/crisis-communications-dos-donts-right-thing/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/170802_Push_Graphic_Featured-3.jpg,"Crisis Communications Dos And Don’ts: Do The Right Thing","Crisis Communications Dos And Don’ts: Do The Right Thing",,"Crisis Communications Dos And Don’ts: Do The Right Thing",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/170802_Push_Graphic_Featured-3.jpg,,Blog,"communications|corporations|crisis|don'ts|dos|morals|right thing",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,crisis-communications-dos-donts-right-thing,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

MOVE ON.

For this crisis communications “do,” we’re taking a tip out of our very own political campaign rulebook. We actually covered this point during our <a href=""http://wesleydonehue.com/corporations-learn-political-campaigns-crisis-equals-opportunity/"">Political Marketing for Corporations</a> series, but we’re going to touch on it just once more.

Since Push has started taking on a ton of corporate work, our eyes have been opened to the inefficiencies of some larger organizations. Generally, the bigger they are, the slower they are. And big businesses can be amazingly unprepared for problems. They react to crises completely differently from the way a political campaign does.

Here’s the difference: campaign managers have fire drills set in place for a number of different crises. They’re prepared to react quickly. Large corporations tend to call their lawyers and have meetings.

In politics OR business, you should recognize every crisis as an opportunity, and pivot to a positive note while you’ve got everyone’s attention. Or as our very own Phil Vangelakos so elegantly put it, “Sometimes the forest needs to burn down for new growth to flourish.”

A really good campaign manager can see the significant opportunities that await beyond the crisis…and maybe even because of the crisis. Why? Because when you’re running a political campaign, you have one goal (to win) and you have a finite timeline to achieve that goal (election day). It’s an absolute waste of time to keep revisiting your mistake because by now you’ve already owned up to the crisis, apologized to no end, explained how you’re going to fix it and now all you need to do is just move on. No matter what, you must keep your eye on the prize. Eventually, the media and press will die down and when it does you’ve already discovered a new path to victory and your team is cruising through the punch list.

Let’s take a look at Taco Bell for example. In 2011, a lawsuit was filed against the fast food chain claiming their “seasoned beef” only contained 35% meat and, therefore, they were making false claims in their advertising. The company pivoted and fired back hard; declaring the lawsuit to be full of lies. Taco Bell released a multi-level PR campaign about their “not-so-secret” recipe across traditional local market newspaper ads, along with a heavy focus on online marketing including a YouTube channel, Facebook page and more.

As a result, the lawsuit was dropped in less than four months and Taco Bell’s social media channels shined with an outpouring of support and positive review from their fans. This was a PR nightmare that was quickly and flawlessly diverted. Taco Bell was not paralyzed by the impending crisis; they fired back at their accuser with a powerful and redeeming campaign and used the attention to shine a positive light on their real “seasoned beef” recipe.

Not every crisis answer has “meat” like Taco Bell’s did. But they replied swiftly, smartly and honestly. And then they moved on. Because they could. Make sure YOU can.","This ""do"" has some serious meat to it.",2017-08-09,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/crisis-communications-dos-donts-move/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/170802_Push_Graphic_Featured-4.jpg,"Crisis Communications Dos And Don’ts: Move On","Crisis Communications Dos And Don’ts: Move On",,"Crisis Communications Dos And Don’ts: Move On",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/170802_Push_Graphic_Featured-4.jpg,,Blog,communications|crisis|don'ts|dos|move|on|pivot,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,crisis-communications-dos-donts-move,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

REBUILD THE BRAND

Real quick, let’s recap our Crisis Communication Dos and Don’ts. By now you’ve already learned that problems will happen. Crisis is inevitable and your team should always be prepared for a rebuttal against any accusations. Regardless of whether or not those nastygrams are 100% true, own up to the mistake and apologize. Then, fix it. And STAT. Whenever possible be transparent and let the public know exactly what you’re doing to fix it. Lastly, since your team is awesome, they’ve already found a way to move on and turn the negative press into positive press. So, what’s next? Rebuild the brand.

Politicians, corporations, celebrities, universities, you name it; if they are marketable then they’ve definitely got a brand. A brand is what defines your company. It’s the image, the core values and your mission statement. And when a company’s world gets rocked with a crisis, that brand gets a black eye and the public sees it. Trust us, it’s never pretty.

While you’re knocking out your company’s new “path to victory” punch list, spruce up your brand. Now, we’re not talking about re-inventing the wheel, but try looking for opportunities to prove you’ve corrected the error in a way that reinforces your brand’s principles. Hop on social media, be personal and candid with your comments, reward customer loyalty by replacing a faulty product for free, and give new customers a reason to do business with incentives and discounts. Everyone loves a comeback kid.

Speaking of comeback kids... let’s talk about McDonald’s, the company that gave birth to the fast food industry in America. In 2004, the documentary Super Size Me was released and quickly the chain was deemed wholly responsible for the nation’s increasing health problems. With almost zero other options, McDonald’s decided to dump a ton of money into revamping their brand and, of course, their menu. The result? A Starbucks-style brick-and-mortar remodeling that is chic and modern accompanied by an array of fresh and healthier menu items like salads. Yes, salads. And, no, we don’t want fries with that! But we will take one large brand rebuilding, please.","When your brand gets knocked down, get back up.",2017-08-10,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/crisis-communications-dos-donts-rebuild-brand/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/170809_Push_Rebuild_FI.jpg,"Crisis Communications Dos and Don’ts: Rebuild The Brand","Crisis Communications Dos and Don’ts: Rebuild The Brand",,"Crisis Communications Dos and Don’ts: Rebuild The Brand",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/170809_Push_Rebuild_FI.jpg,,Blog,brand|communications|crisis|don'ts|dos|rebuild,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,crisis-communications-dos-donts-rebuild-brand,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

KNOW THE BATTLEFIELD

In case you didn’t catch it in our name, Push Digital is a digital firm. Good thing. Because this Crisis Communications “Do” is: Know the battlefield. And what is the battlefield? It’s the internet. The internet is now and will always be the battlefield. Every single day until forever. Things just don’t go away and we certainly can’t see the internet dying any time soon. With that being said, when you’re in the midst of a crisis, recovering from a crisis or being prepared just in case of a crisis, here are three tips to keep in mind.

1. Post Wisely
Whether you’re a ten-year-old girl, an accountant, or a politician running for office, we cannot stress how important it is to be cautious when posting online. Your digital footprint leaves a permanent trail on the internet and it paints a picture of your brand and character. Rogue tweets are literally what trolls live for and they cannot be swept under the rug or washed away by the rain. Whatever you do, control the trolls—don’t make it easy for someone to ding you or your company. “Going viral” is great unless it’s you.

2. Know Your Opponent
Carefully follow your opponents and competitors to get an inside look into their digital marketing strategy. What content is working for them? What content totally flopped? Who is their target audience? How did they respond to a crisis? They say imitation is the purest form of flattery, but learning from other people’s mistakes so you don’t have to is just plain smart.

3. Be Relevant
From platform updates to new social media management tools, the weapons in your digital marketing arsenal are constantly changing. By the time you’ve mastered one, another one gets released and another one becomes irrelevant. Stay on top of the trends by learning from and reading industry articles. Make time for making yourself and your business better. Then be first to market it with the latest tips and tools. It pays to beat your competitor.

Boxing ring, football field, tennis court, softball diamond, poker table—the wise competitor knows the battlefield. Always.","Forget love, the internet is a battlefield.",2017-08-11,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/crisis-communications-dos-donts-know-battlefield/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/170802_Push_Graphic_Featured-5.jpg,"Crisis Communications Dos And Don’ts: Know The Battlefield","Crisis Communications Dos And Don’ts: Know The Battlefield",,"Crisis Communications Dos And Don’ts: Know The Battlefield",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/170802_Push_Graphic_Featured-5.jpg,,Blog,battlefield|communications|crisis|digital|internet|know,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,crisis-communications-dos-donts-know-battlefield,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

KNOW AND LABEL THE OPPONENT

Time, money, communication… this Crisis Communications “Do” gives us yet another bullet to add to our list of differences between political campaigns and corporations: The Opponent.

In politics, it could not be any clearer who your opponent is. After all, your opponent is perhaps the exact reason why you’re running for public office. When you’re putting together a kick-ass platform, a good campaign manager—heck, even a crappy campaign manager—can rattle off your opponent’s platform at the blink of an eye. Otherwise, how else are you going to persuade the people that you are the obvious and only choice at the polls? You either know your opponent like the back of your hand… or you lose. It’s that simple.

In business, however, you have tons of opponents, which means the real enemy isn’t always clear. Is it your nearest or direct competitor? Is it a town council? Is it the radical activist who spread a false story? During a crisis, make sure you know who you’re fighting.

Similar to our <a href=""http://www.pushdigital.com/corporations-learn-political-campaigns-crisis-equals-opportunity/"">Crisis = Opportunity blog</a>, you can also turn your opponents into opportunities. Here’s how:

1. Define them. Who is your opposing force? If you don’t know who they are, then you can’t beat them. If your opponent is in the same industry, then they must have a similar weakness. So exploit it.

2. Understand them. Study their strategy, because what’s working for them will most likely work for you. A super cute puppy video with proceeds going to charity? Done. Just use kittens.

3. Set the agenda. If you’re in a crisis, you be the one to control the narrative, not your opponents. A game of telephone without your input is brand reputation suicide, so act quickly while being honest and transparent.

4. Expose them. When the opposition gives you lemons… squeeze it into their eyes. If your opponent is the reason you’re in a crisis, great. Tell the world and become an underdog! Everyone loves an underdog.

5. Learn from them. Whether you’re in a crisis or preparing for one, learn from your opponent’s past. Crises happen to everyone, so learn from their crisis mistakes so you don’t have to make your own.","Know them so you can beat them.",2017-08-14,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/crisis-communications-dos-donts-know-label-opponent/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/170802_Push_Graphic_Featured-6.jpg,"Crisis Communications Dos And Don’ts: Know And Label The Opponent","Crisis Communications Dos And Don’ts: Know And Label The Opponent",,"Crisis Communications Dos And Don’ts: Know And Label The Opponent",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/170802_Push_Graphic_Featured-6.jpg,,Blog,communications|crisis|define|don'ts|dos|label|opponent,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,crisis-communications-dos-donts-know-label-opponent,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

GET ALL OF THE FACTS

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether you’re actually in a crisis or not, if there is going to be a story about you or your business circulating around the world, then you should be the one to control the narrative. Choosing to clam up is not an option. By clamming up, people will only hear one side of the story, and then their imaginations will run wild with the rest. Just picture that game of telephone you played as a kid, but now imagine millions of people making memes and hiding behind their computer screens. Trust us, it’s 1000x more traumatic and you absolutely do not want that. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, let’s not get ahead of ourselves here. If you find yourself in a crisis, before you can even think about controlling the narrative, you have to gather ALL of the facts. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Step one is talking to every single person involved. Hop on a conference call, shoot out a company-wide email, or make hundreds of individual phone calls if you have to. Get it done. After all, you can’t tell your story if you don’t know all of the facts, and you won’t know all of the facts if you’re not asking the questions.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Step two is all about keeping calm. While you’re taking the time to talk to everyone involved, remember that there are multiple sides to every story, so try not to jump to conclusions. Often when there are a lot of cooks in the kitchen, the first story you hear is not necessarily  the complete or correct version. So make sure while you’re talking to your troops that they’re not leaking any intel. If you’re not ready to talk, neither are they. And they have to know that.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Step three is expect the unexpected. When you’re dealing with people, and especially in a crisis, you cannot let your emotions get in the way. Work with the facts and not your feelings.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Getting all the facts sounds simple, but it isn’t. You likely didn’t start a business career hoping to be a detective. But here you are. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So make sure there is a plan or protocol in place BEFORE some reporter calls.  You can’t react like ants do when the hill’s been knocked over.  Speak with your key stakeholders to have a simple but comprehensive way to gather all the facts.

TALK TO ATTORNEYS (SPARINGLY)

Attorneys are important to keep you out of jail, but they can also gum up the system and make it impossible for you to respond quickly enough.

So what should you do? Read on.

For starters, please note that this is NOT an anti-attorney piece. OK, it kind of is. But you need to realize the way attorneys look at an issue and the way YOU look at an issue could be (and probably are) two COMPLETELY different things.

It can take a long time to fully understand this. It can be frustrating and painful. So do yourself a favor—learn from our mistakes.

Attorneys are risk averse. By nature, they are. “Should we take a risk, or should we NOT take a risk?” “Not.” The only way to be close to 100% certainty or safety is NOT to try skiing, or walking across a rickety old footbridge, or buying property, or responding to a news story.

What you are really looking for is an evaluation of the risk, not a total avoidance of it. Because, ultimately, you will have to make the call if you are in charge. In court, the attorneys speak. When the reporters come around, you do.

Attorneys will generally advise you to say as little as possible. This can seem to be at cross purposes with you or your company’s desire to be open and transparent. The attorneys aren’t wrong. Smart business leaders know what to say. Remember our post on getting the facts? Start there. “Here’s what we know.” That may not be much. But if it’s a fact, you could share it.

Attorneys will also generally advise you NOT to issue an apology. They see an apology as an admission of guilt. It is not. But think of it this way: Attorneys are trying to keep you (and/or your company) out of trouble. That is something you want as well.

Two key points: (1) our headline on the blog actually offers two tips in one. Talk to attorneys. Before you sign. Before you buy. Before you agree. Before you announce. (Sparingly) Attorneys have their own way of doing things. Fine. And you have yours. Keep it that way. Don’t become weak-kneed. Attorneys don’t need to hold your hand through everything. (2) This topic underscores once again the importance of having a crisis communications plan and team in place BEFORE A CRISIS HITS. Attorneys should be an important part of that.

One last point: some of our best friends are attorneys. Really and truly. Many of the politicians we know and have represented and many of our lobbyist friends are lawyers. They know things that you don’t. They can do things that you can’t. Good people to have in your corner.","Don't get me wrong, attorneys are great.",2017-08-16,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/crisis-communications-dos-donts-attorneys/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/170802_Push_Graphic_Featured-9.jpg,"Crisis Communications Dos And Don’ts: Talk To Attorneys (Sparingly)","Crisis Communications Dos And Don’ts: Talk To Attorneys (Sparingly)",,"Crisis Communications Dos And Don’ts: Talk To Attorneys (Sparingly)",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/170802_Push_Graphic_Featured-9.jpg,,Blog,attorneys|communications|crisis|don'ts|dos|talk,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,crisis-communications-dos-donts-attorneys,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
1502,"Crisis Communications Dos And Don’ts: Don’t Feed The Trolls. But Do Feed The Beast.","<a href=""http://wesleydonehue.com/11-dos-donts-crisis-communications/"">This is part 9 of an 11 part series.</a>

DON’T FEED THE TROLLS. BUT DO FEED THE BEAST.

When a crisis hits the internet, you can bet that trolls are standing by to gobble up your content and preparing to make hundreds of awfully mean memes. The fact is, you will never make trolls happy no matter how many questions you answer. And the internet will always demand more content. Fast content. Real content. Just lots and lots of content. Here’s how you can control the trolls during a crisis.

1. Humor The Trolls
Using comedic relief to respond to comments during a crisis is an absolutely brilliant tactic. However, you have to be careful because humor is not a universal language. One person’s sense of humor can be the complete opposite from another’s. Then you have the fact that they’re reading your comment from behind a screen. It’s a crap shoot. But if done correctly, using humor to engage with the public can create a more real and genuine interaction, rather than a stuffy canned response that was approved by your legal team. Just think about it—in less than 140 characters, you can defuse a troll’s negative comment and create a positive engagement by simply being lighthearted and real.

2. Counter-Fact
Trolls have one job and that is to dig up dirt, stir up trouble and spread rumors. And during a crisis, your team’s job is to nip it in the bud. So far we’ve learned one way to combat the rumors: WITH FACTS. When you’re on trial, how do you prove innocence? With evidence. So, when you’re dealing with fictional stories that are swirling around the internet, it’s no different. Engage the trolls with the cold, hard facts and address the crisis head-on. You’ll stop the trolls and their slanderous tales right in their tracks.

3. Don’t Join Them
Recently, we’ve been noticing a lot of corporations attempting to troll their customers. Cough... Wendy’s. And we love it. But we’re also slightly terrified of it. Corporate trolling is tricky, and as much as you want to serve the sass right back, we have to recommend that you refrain. Don’t stoop to their level. Very rarely does corporate trolling pan out as originally intended. Just as there is a fine line between teasing and bullying your kid brother, the same goes here. When in doubt, just kill ‘em with kindness; because the second you’re seen as bitter or weak, the trolls will just keep throwing you under the bus. And that hurts.

4. Feed The Beast
During a crisis, content is key. While you’re doing a stellar job of being honest and transparent, start creating content that will keep the public informed about your efforts to fix the mistake. When you’ve positively pivoted away from the situation, share an infographic with all of the positive statistics about your company. Or push out a sizzle reel showcasing some of your best work. Don’t forget your employees! Post pictures of your all-stars and put faces to YOUR name. Real people working for a real company. Like we’ve said before, you never know when you’re going to get punched in the face with a crisis, but the punch is inevitable.

1508,"The Confederate Flag In My Attic","I have a beautifully framed confederate flag. It flew over the South Carolina statehouse and it has a nice letter from, then, State Senator Joe Wilson framed with it. It used to hang on my home office wall. And now sits in my attic. Elizabeth and I decided to take it down years ago. We saw the flag as heritage, not hate. But then one day we realized that it’s not about how we see it. It was about how our African American friends saw it. We weren’t selfish enough to fly a symbol that made other people uncomfortable in our home. And let’s not try to rewrite history the way liberals are trying to rewrite history - African Americans have a damn good reason to feel uncomfortable and if you can’t put yourself in their shoes here, something is straight up wrong with your brain.

We saw the flag as a symbol of our heritage. But how can we defend that symbol when it is being used by the most vile people in the world to promote hate? The short answer is that we cannot. As Christians, we are supposed to love everyone and that symbol, whether we like it are not, shows the complete opposite.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-1509"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20768094_10105608922411447_8983831476754439294_n-225x300.jpg"" alt=""confederate flag"" width=""450"" height=""600"" />

Now, lets talk about heritage and this argument that confederate soldiers were somehow treasonous. Three important points here:

First, the super majority of those soldiers who died WERE NOT wealthy slave owners. They were poor young men.

Second, the view of our nation then was not what it is now. Those men lived in the “United States,” which means a group of individual and self governed states that came together under one banner. National pride was not what it is now. Pride was in the states. I know that’s hard to imagine now given the size of the federal government and the near dissolution of states’ right, but those are historical facts and not opinions.

Finally, there was a draft here. Regardless of the reason for fighting, those men would have been treasonous if they would not have answered the call to the draft. It doesn’t matter how we see the flag. The super majority of Americans, especially our African American brothers and sisters, see that flag as hate because horrible humans are using it as such. That doesn’t mean though that we should rewrite history, rip down confederate solider monuments and label those dead soldiers by today’s completely different standards.

How do we honor those soldiers who fought for our home without looking racist? I have absolutely no EFFing clue. Good luck with that.","It's not about heritage anymore.",2017-08-18,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/confederate-flag-attic/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20768094_10105608922411447_8983831476754439294_n.jpg,"The Confederate Flag In My Attic","The confederate flag in my attic",,"The confederate flag in my attic",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/20768094_10105608922411447_8983831476754439294_n.jpg,,Blog,"attic|confederate|confederate flag|heritage|racism|south|southern|symbol",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,confederate-flag-attic,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
1515,"Crisis Communications Dos And Don'ts: Measure. Always. Always Measure.","<a href=""http://wesleydonehue.com/11-dos-donts-crisis-communications/"">This part 10 of an 11 part series.</a>

MEASURE. ALWAYS. ALWAYS MEASURE.

How often should you poll? Let us ask you this: how often are vital signs taken during a medical emergency? Constantly. That may be more often than is practical or affordable for your company, but the short answer is: measure public sentiment as often as you can.

You should always have a (recent) baseline study regarding how your business (and industry, etc.) is perceived. You need this for comparison’s sake, among other things. Next you need to have the people, places or technology in place to take the pulse for you—people on your staff? Outside firm? Focus groups? Online surveys? There are arguments both in favor or against all of these, so you have a lot of decisions to make.

Sometimes you know exactly what has happened and what the repercussions are likely to be. But often that is not the case. And today, you have to be able to get some help determining whether “Twitter is blowing up” because of a legitimate news story or because of some very active trolls. Read that part again. This is important. It is more difficult now to know for certain whether or not a real storm is coming.

If it is, you should have your team in place (as we have mentioned MANY times)—which may include a research company or part of your staff. As quickly as possible, get a pulse. Is it as bad as you thought? Worse? Are there misconceptions to address? Polling can help a lot in crafting messages and responding properly. What should you do after taking the pulse? Take another pulse!

If there IS a legitimate crisis, make sure everyone at your company knows what is going on—not because they will be speaking to the press, but because they will be asked by everyone they know (if it’s a big enough story or a small enough town). Circulating a simple FAQ sheet will help everyone and keep the rumors to a minimum.

Have you ever heard the carpenter’s advice? “Measure twice, cut once.” That's good advice. What we would change, as it pertains to polling, is the number of times you measure.","Measure. Measure.

Crisis Communications Dos And Don'ts: HAVE YOUR CRISIS TEAM IN PLACE BEFORE A CRISIS HAPPENS.

Robert Greene published “The 48 Laws of Power” in 1998 but Donald Trump was practicing those laws well before then. President Trump should have made each of his campaign and White House staffers read the book before their first day on the job. Perhaps then they would have been ready for the daily crisis that is President Donald J. Trump.

Greene writes of Law 6: “Court Attention At All Cost

""Everything is judged by its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing. Never let yourself get lost in the crown, then, or buried in oblivion. Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost. Make yourself a magnet of attention by appearing larger, more colorful, more mysterious than the bland and timid masses.”

Priebus, Spicer, Scaramucci, Bannon. None of them were ready for the way Trump plays this law daily and the backlash it can have on the performer and those around him. “All attention is good attention,” is Trump’s motto. That may even be his daily affirmation as he sits down to draft his first tweet of the day with the proactive plan of creating a crisis.

There may be no one in history who can manipulate the media like Trump can. And there in lies the problem. Because he’s better than anyone, his team can’t control him or even catch up to him. Unfortunately for the American people, the crisis isn’t in Trump’s brand as much as he thinks it is. The crisis is the impact on the legislative agenda. Or lack there of.

I tell my clients often “I can save you from outside forces. I cannot, however, save you from yourself.” This is where Trump’s team finds themselves. They then turn their conflict inward, completely unprepared and attacking each other because they cannot attack the source of the crisis, their employer.

For Trump’s team, there is only one way to be prepared for the coming crisis - stop thinking about how there may be a crisis and, instead, know that a new crisis will arise every single day as long as Donald Trump is President of the United States and as long as he continues to play with Green’s sixth law. Always be in crisis mode. Lean on each other. Create an unbreakable loyal team that will not turn on each other through petty leaks and power plays. Have a General in place (now literally) who can make the final call for the team. Always believe the worst is coming. Because it is.

Companies must do the same. They must have a team in place that understands crisis and is ready to move immediately. They must stop thinking about IF and start thinking about WHEN. The team must be smart, fast, flexible and most of all loyal - not just to the boss, but to each other.

There are many tips to get you through a crisis, but every single of of them relies on a solid team is who ready to mobilize the second a crisis hits.","Crisis Communications Dos And Don'ts: HAVE YOUR CRISIS TEAM IN PLACE BEFORE A CRISIS HAPPENS.",2017-08-22,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/donald-trumps-team-isnt-prepared-daily-crisis-donald-trump/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/part-11-twitter.png,"Donald Trump's Team Isn't Prepared For The Daily Crisis That Is Donald Trump","Donald Trump's Team Isn't Prepared For The Daily Crisis That Is Donald Trump",,"Donald Trump's Team Isn't Prepared For The Daily Crisis That Is Donald Trump",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/part-11-twitter.png,,Blog,"communications|crisis|daily|donald trump|prepared|president|team",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,donald-trumps-team-isnt-prepared-daily-crisis-donald-trump,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

1538,"I’M POSITIVE ABOUT FIGHTING NEGATIVITY","What’s up guys? Are y’all awesome or what? Great.

Recently, people who follow my <a href=""http://wesleydonehue.com/this-is-about-positive-vibes/"">VLOGS </a>and social media accounts have been commenting about how often I am encouraging “positive vibes.” Well listen here. There is a reason for it. You can read about it <a href=""http://wesleydonehue.com/so-many-positive-vibes/"">here</a>… OR just keep reading and I’ll step on my soapbox once more.

Why am I throwing out so many positive vibes? To cast away the cesspool of negativity in the world. For the last several years, I’ve been a shamefully unhappy person. It sickens me to think about it because this kid from the ghetto has so much great shit to be thankful for. My smoking hot wife, my beautiful baby boys (and future trekkies) and all of my entrepreneurial enterprises. I am #blessed beyond being.

Many of you reading this will understand, but as an entrepreneur… my work isn’t just Monday through Friday from 9 to 5. My mind is always thinking about high-level strategy for my clients, are we going to make payroll, or what’s the flip is up with our office expansion? My mind is a business machine 24/7 and 365.

Anyways, during my commute to the pool this morning at 6AM, I had some quality thinking time. Just me and my old friend Wesley. I’m unhappy because I am surrounded by literally so much effing negativity. The news is negative. Facebook is negative. And even our clients are negative —which makes my employees negative. This is unfortunate because often times I find myself bringing my negativity home, which is not ok.

Here’s the catch: it’s still my job to grow audiences. For our political candidates and advocacy clients, we work to attract more followers, and then to push (get it?) those people to action—to volunteer, to vote, to donate, to contact a legislator, to side with us on a bill. Makes sense?

We do this with creative content that gets people interested and involved. And you want to know what isn’t working? Positivity. What works? Anger. The current state of American politics is depression inducing negativity. Sure, we could do an ad or write a blog supporting our troops overseas. People love a good soldier coming home story, but right now the new rhetoric is anti-immigration, building dystopian-style walls, and slapping sex scandals in people’s faces.

It’s sad, but it’s true—right now, everything that works online is negative. Because right now, that’s what the people want. And it’s hurting me deeply to serve it up and to be a participant in an atmosphere of vitriol. I did not get into this business to be a fear monger. But there is a HORRIBLE negative vibe in this country right now—and it’s been coming from both sides for some time now.

So, I’m putting my foot down. If news and political strategies ain’t changing, I sure as hell am. For my health, for my office’s aura, and most importantly for my family. I encourage everyone else (and myself) to give off ONLY positive vibes. I start each day that way. I hope and trust and believe things will change. Yes. Change for the better.

I’m positive about it.","No more negative bullshit.",2017-08-24,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/im-positive-fighting-negativity/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Push_PositiveVibes1_964x482.jpg,"I’M POSITIVE ABOUT FIGHTING NEGATIVITY","positive about fighting negativity",,"positive about fighting negativity",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Push_PositiveVibes1_964x482.jpg,,Blog,"change|life style|negativity|Politics|positive|positive vibes",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,im-positive-fighting-negativity,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

The active tropical cyclone is causing unprecedented flooding and the shocking amount of rainfall has the potential to overflow regional dams, which will more than double the current scope of damage. At this rate, by Wednesday morning, there will have been more than 50 inches of rainfall since last Friday.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">FEMA Director, Brock Long, is calling this the the worst disaster in Texas history. So far, the estimated economic loss is reported to be upwards of $40-$60 billion, with at least 15 precious lives lost. Evacuees have been strongly warned to stay away from their homes until notified otherwise by the authorities. Even a league of local heroes have launched rescue missions, by boat, in order to scan the flooded Houston-area horizons to save those that are trapped. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Recovery from the incomprehensible flooding is expected to take several years.</span>

You see, SeaWorld knew they needed something to refocus the public's attention and our job was to come up with that piece of creative that would cut through the noise and make people feel good about visiting the parks.

The needed a mission - a big one.

We’re happy to be part of a company working so hard to fix one of our world's biggest problems - stopping an mass extinction. We didn't arrive at this mission lightly. First of all, SeaWorld is one of the only companies around that can credibly boast the ability to impact the death of the world's oceans. Second, they have a 50 year proven commitment to saving animals.

What they needed was to show the world a different SeaWorld - and this campaign is a disruptive force for changing the way the public views the company.

The collaboration that went into building this campaign was an amazing experience. All sorts of folks around the Push offices got involved. It was a pressure cooker, but a rewarding experience. From copy writing, to those amazing visuals and the music - it all had to fit just right.

1562,"Don't Stop Moving","Hey there. It’s 5 am on Wednesday. I’m sitting in an airport in Madison, Wisconsin where I had a couple of meetings yesterday. Now I'm headed back home, where I’ll immediately go to swim practice, then to the office and then finally home... all before I leave <em>again</em> tomorrow morning for the mountains of North Carolina for the Blue Ridge Relay.

It’s GO GO GO GO GO all the time. I can’t say that I don’t love it. You know I do. I don’t rest well. Everyone makes fun of me because I don’t know how to vacation. It’s a running joke around the office. It’s not so funny to Elizabeth.

I get anxious when I rest. I feel like I should be doing something to move myself, my family and my businesses forward towards our goals. There’s always something to do. Or there is always something I could be doing. Always.

It’s hardwired within me. Even when there is absolutely zero fuel left in the tank, I will sit on the couch with a bottle of wine to watch a movie and I'll constantly be on my phone just waiting for an email to arrive in my inbox. I’ll stare blankly at a screen, trying to respond to an email without the ability to muster up the energy to actually type a word.

Why not just put the phone down? Why not get it all out of my mind?

I don’t know. I wish I had the answer to that question. I just don’t. I’m not sure I ever will. Some people can knock off work at 5pm. Like Fred Flintstone, they can hear the bird yell, say “yabba dabba doo,” slide on down the dinosaur’s tail and never think about work again or until they clock in the next day.

I don’t know how to be Fred Flintstone. Even if I knew how, I don’t think my brain would even let me do it. It’s like trying to swim right now. I hear my coach tell me that I need to straighten my body out and get long. I know that’s what I’m supposed to do. But my shoulder and back muscles will not allow my arms to straighten directly over my head. My brain knows what to do but my body won’t let it happen.

Before attempting my first triathlon, my coach gave me great advice “just keep moving. If you get tired, roll over and backstroke. Survival stroke if you have to. Just don’t stop moving.” That’s also the plan for this weekend as I go into the Blue Ridge Relay, a 200 mile relay in the mountains, a much different terrain than the flat coastal lands of Charleston, South Carolina. On the toughest climbs the goal is to run/walk. Run a few minutes and then walk a minute. There’s no shame in that. But there is shame in stopping —in not moving.

I know I’m not normal. I know most people can stop and <em>relax</em>. And I know that it will one day take a toll on me. It already is. But I don’t think you have to be abnormal like me to build a business or to run a marathon. It’s okay to relax. But most of you are relaxing all the time. You spend half or more of the 24 hours in your day relaxing.

Convince yourself that being still is bad. Stagnation is the devil.

There are many problems with the three-tier system of alcohol distribution in America. In today’s vlog I talk about one of them - the inability of craft brewers to control their own product.

We can’t control the price. We can’t control who sells our product. We can’t control our branding once it leaves our property.

And frankly, that’s a pretty minor problem compared to all the other major issues - like how we legally can’t even fire a distributor once we’re in a contract. This one just happens to be what has me HOT today after seeing one of our beers sold for $9 a pint.

We typically like the distributors we work with. We typically like the folks who sell our product. And to be clear - most brewers don’t want to even distribute their own beer. What brewers want is control over their product and real accountability.

We’ll address the other big issues later.

Enjoy! And share please.

1573,"Nothing But Positive Vibes Coming On This Blog","For years I’ve tried to launch a successful blog. And by successful, I don’t mean something that millions of people are reading or one that can be monetized. I just mean one that I can consistently publish quality and consistent content that may be useful to you. You know, stuff I’m learning as I hustle my little heart out.

Recently, I’ve been posting a lot of different stuff here. I’ve posted all the content we’re pumping out from Push. I’m posting my new VLOG. I’m posting my random personal thoughts and fitness updates.

Today I’m reorganizing this mess. Here you’ll find all my personal stuff. You’ll get my thoughts on a lot of random things, including entrepreneurship, politics, technology and fitness. But I’ll help you cut through the clutter by tossing all the Push content back over to Push. Perhaps I will occasionally post a summary of a bunch of posts all at one time if I think that’s useful to you.

You know how much I believe in content. We have it coming from so many different angles that it’s honestly hard to keep up. My assistant, Sally, is crushing that. Now it’s on me to keep us organized.

Speaking of me, life is great. Thanks for asking. Work has been steady. The family is awesome. Training is frustrating, BUT I'm progressing. Honestly, I’m just ready to get back into a routine. Last week was Labor Day and then I was on the road and then we let the team off on Friday to evacuate Charleston early. Today, I’m sitting here watching the Lowcountry get pounded, while power and wifi flickers on and off. I hope we’re cool to get back to work tomorrow. You know me. I'm itching.

Have a great night. And if you’re in the South Carolina Lowcountry or in Hurricane Irma’s path, hunker down and stay safe.

1579,"Southern Charm Is Not Representative Of Charleston","VLOG Episode 8 is full of college football, my wonderful family, cuteness and tons of positive vibes. It also includes a rant about Southern Charm. Oops. Sometimes that negativity does creep in no matter how hard you fight
it.

I love Charleston. It’s one of my favorite cities in the world and now everyone is starting to agree. How many times now have we been named Best City In America? Like five years in a row?

This is where I was raised. This is where I will raise my kids. That’s why I get so annoyed when I get that same old question every single time I fly outside of our state’s borders - “do you know the Southern Charm cast members?”

AAAAAGGGGGHHHHHHH!!

1620,"The Best Fitness Advice I Can Give You","The journey toward the tattoo continues…

It’s been a chaotic two weeks in my life as I’ve been training my face off for my first Ironman 70.3. As a result, a lot of things have fallen through the cracks. I can’t let the family and the business fall through the cracks, so that means the blog and vlog have been on the back burner.

BUT I’M BACK!

I’m no fitness stud, but I have come a long way from a guy who didn’t work out at all –to a guy who is doing crazy endurance events.  And so a lot of people ask me for workout advice. My advice is simple - don’t workout. Train!

That’s what I talk about in this video.

Let me take a quick moment to thank all of you for the support as I work to become an Ironman and get my first tattoo in 2018. The number of encouraging calls, texts and messages has been unbelievable. I hope I can return the favor as you attempt to knock out big goals. A special thank you to Elizabeth, Chris and Jamie - my smoking hot wife, my coach and my assistant coach / chief encourager. I’ll talk a lot more about them in the coming days as I post my AARs.

1624,"Two Tips For Training Your Face Off","My friendly followers, welcome to the blog. It’s been awhile since I last put pen to paper and wrote something real for y’all. Unfortunately, when you're training your face off, scheduling some last minute biz dev trips and have 2 beautiful children and a smoking hot wife… some things are bound to get put on the back-burner. Sorry blog, that was you. But I’m back, so let’s begin.

During all my training I got a lot of direct messages from people asking me about what kind of “workouts” they should be doing and what kind of “tips” I can give them. First of all, I’m super humbled. Seriously, thank you. Because y’all know I used to never work out. So that’s probably the biggest compliment you could ever give me… asking me for fitness advice. It’s mind blowing. Secondly, if you’re remotely like me, then you can’t just work out. You have to train. And that’s what I’m going to talk about today.

Pause for a second - I'm not the type who should be giving you fitness advice. I don't have a six pack. I'm not placing high in my races. What I AM is the type who can give you advice on knocking out goals. That's what I'm good at.

Let’s rewind. About this time last year, I made up my mind. It was time to get my very first tattoo. But not just any old tattoo where I go down to the the Blue Gorilla. I wanted to earn it. An Ironman tattoo. In my opinion, it’s a big symbol of badassery. Since then, I’ve been obsessed and training like a madman. But, I knew if I ever wanted to reach that goal, then I had to train. You see, working out doesn't cut it. Working out may be about improvement, but there's not big goal. There's no big day staring you in the face that gets closer every single minute. There's no actual reason to get out of bed. Nothing is forcing you to move.

Training is the exact opposite. It's about crushing your goals and tackling your fears. Dedication. Determination. Accountability. Whether you like it or not, that starting line is coming your way and you better be ready for it.

Here are my two tips for making your fitness goals a reality:

1.) Set Actual Goals Along The Way
Wrapping my mind around competing in an Ironman Triathlon was a daunting task itself. I’m a runner, and I’ve been running now for about three years. However, I don’t bike… and here’s the thing, I’m a 37 year old man that does not know how to swim. At all. So it’s safe to say I had some very real and like straight up fears about to punch me in the face. So what did I do? I loaded up my calendar with swim lessons and sprint tri’s all the way up until my Half Ironman. Literally, I had an event almost every other weekend since March, and now I’m back at it this weekend with the Middleton Half-Marathon. Just because I met my huge goal for 2017 doesn’t mean I’m done –no, not even close. It’s time to start training for my full Ironman in 2018.

2.) Build A Support System
Charleston is an amazing place to be obsessed with fitness, and it’s not just to counteract all of the crazy good food we get to eat. The weather is insane 80% of the time and it’s absolutely true what they say about the people. At least in the exercise scene, they’re literally as nice as can be… it must be all of the endorphins. A few years ago I somehow managed to stumble into a support group called F3 and I made bunch of badass new friends that helped and continue to help keep me accountable along the way. Every Facebook and Instagram post, which I know is a lot, gets flooded with Positive Vibes and encouragements. Seriously, not once did I ever feel alone, even when I was scraped up on the side of the road with hamburger for an elbow. Could not appreciate all of y’all any more.

And that right there is the best fitness advice I can give you. Train, do not work out. Set actual goals for yourself along the way. Most importantly, find some awesome people to keep you accountable.","Get your mind right.",2017-10-27,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/training-vs-working/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-27-at-2.04.07-PM.png,"Two Tips For Training Your Face Off","Two Tips For Training Your Face Off",,"Two Tips For Training Your Face Off",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-27-at-2.04.07-PM.png,,Blog|Fitness,accountability|Charleston|Fitness|goals|ironman|training|triathlon,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,training-vs-working,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
1627,"The Positivity In This T-Shirt Matters Most","We got new company t-shirts made and I absolutely friggin’ love them.

If it weren't for what my company does I would totally get off of social media right now. Digital platforms were supposed to be the place where we all came together and solved the world's problems. Or at least that's what I told myself.

I jumped headfirst into digital because I saw a place where all of human knowledge was at our fingertips and surely, with that much knowledge and our ability to talk to one another, we could do amazing things. Hell, that's why I got into politics in the first place. I grew up in shit and I blamed the government. Politics was a way for me to change that shit so other kids wouldn't have to grow up in the same shit. Yes, I was naive as hell.

Then the web exploded. ""There it is, right there,"" I told myself. Everything I thought about politics, the ability to make real change happen to help actual people, now it's powered. Now there are tools. BOOM! We're on the fast track to becoming that Utopian world we see on Star Trek.

Except that's not what happened. Man, I really am stupidly optimistic at times. I knew better. My best strength, and why I'm so damn good at politics and marketing, is that I understand people. I should have known that the worst in humanity would come out when they could hide behind a keyboard, when they didn't have to look you in the eye to insult you and to let their hate flow. I want to believe in the best of humanity. I still do believe. I hate being proven wrong.

Negativity fills our feeds 100x more than an honest discussion of the problems facing our world. I've tested it. A lot. I post about an issue with a logical argument meant to fuel an intelligent conversation. It lasts for about five comments until the train derails and ""friends"" begin vomiting negativity all over my post.

So here's the big problem for me - I cannot escape it. I cannot just get off social media platforms. I own a digital marketing agency. We live on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and worst off all, blogs. That means negativity permeates throughout and across my company 24/7. There's only one way to keep the team full of the happy vibes that fuel creative work - demand it. All day. Everywhere. Never ending.

This isn't the first time I've told you this. I wrote an article a couple months back and someone commented on my LinkedIn post:

""I'm not onboard with the 'positive vibes only' movement, especially at work. Of course, generally speaking, we should all do our best to be positive as much as we can. But - we shouldn't have to pretend to be happy after a really rough day - it should be okay to say ""I'm stressed out,” or even ""I'm pissed off with what happened there.” Anger, frustration, boredom and a whole other spectrum of negative emotions are totally, 100% normal, and I think you'll find that if your employees aren't allowed to express them, it'll come out in other ways.""

First off, I didn't know that it was a movement. Awesome! I hope I started it.

Secondly, I'm not saying that staffers can't express themselves. Let's not fake this shit. I'm saying that due to the industry in which we find ourselves, negativity is forced upon my staff. As the boss it's my job to counteract that as much as possible. If I do not, the negativity will make them something they are not and that is worse than them pretending to be something.

Thirdly, the inability to stop oneself from expressing ""anger, frustration and boredom"" is what children do. That's not what adults at work should do.

That leads me to the new t-shirts. The staff wanted to get some tees to proudly show where they work. I thought it would be another great reminder that here at Push we're all about POSITIVE VIBES! We will fight the negative bullshit with as many PVs as possible.

As for the mascot... that's Bentley, one of the five office pups we have bringing mad Positive Vibes to the team.

1630,"Why and How We Get Sh*t Done","It's how every agency pitches their business, ""We're different."" That alone makes them the same. And, really, not a very creative agency at all.

I prefer to say that Push is not the traditional digital agency that you'd find in our corporate America. It's our political DNA that truly makes us different to our core.

Push utilizes its experience from the hardest fought political campaigns in the nation and it's speed and agility to help campaigns, corporations and advocacy groups solve their reputation problems in the digital space.

We're different because I, nor any of our leaders, have ever worked at a marketing agency. We're all political operatives. That means our agency isn't even organized, or built, like a normal agency. Hell, I don't even know how a traditional agency is built. I've never researched it. And I don't care to either. Because corporate America is slow as hell and that lack of speed defines most of their problems.

Like a finely tuned Formula 1 race car, every inch of Push is built for speed. We hug corners and zoom down the straight aways. We react, pivot and move faster than any agency you'll ever find.

That's important for two reasons:

First, we don't just launch big marketing campaigns. We run reputation campaigns, many of which happen during a crisis. A reputation can be formed or changed in minutes. Think about your opinion of Kevin Spacey on Sunday. Now think of your opinion of Kevin Space today (Tuesday morning). One minute he's one of your favorite actors. The next he's a pedophile. Damn, that changed fast.

Secondly, the Internet waits for no one. A rumor or a lie can become the truth in just seconds as it's shared by thousands, then tens of thousands, then millions. You have to react immediately and you can't do that unless you're built to react immediately.

Reputation + the Internet = a raging fire!

Yes, we're creative. Yes, we're data-driven. Yes, we're innovative. Yes, we're pretty damn smart. But, so are most of our competitors.

What truly sets us apart is our speed, intensity and endurance. Those traits were gained through decades in the political trenches. You don't just learn them. You become them.

To put it simply - we get shit done.","We'll never be run like you're typical agency... because I don't even know what that means.",2017-10-31,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/get-sht-done/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/171031_Push_Fast_Featured.jpg,"Why and How We Get Sh*t Done","why and how we get shit done",,"why and how we get shit done",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/171031_Push_Fast_Featured.jpg,,Blog,Charleston|done|marketing|political|Push|shit,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,get-sht-done,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

1644,"Teamwork Makes The Dream Work","Everyone is busy. No one has enough time.

Except, I don't think that's true. We all have the same amount of time in the day. Some days are busier than others. In fact, some days are so busy that you can't even find time to go to the bathroom. I've been there. And you've been there. But some days just aren't that busy. You might find yourself with an extra twenty minutes here and an extra ten minutes there. So, what do you do with those extra minutes? Do you shop on Amazon? Do you check out Instagram and see what your friends did last night?

Here's a <em>good</em> answer: How about helping out your teammate that can't find the time to take a leak?

That's exactly what I'm trying to drill into the heads of the Push staff. Push isn't about one person. It's the sum of its parts and all of those parts must operate seamlessly together, like a well oiled machine, where one part relies on the efficiency of another part.

1653,"Technology Is Killing Our Client Relationships","As a digital company, we have to stay on top of the latest technology trends, not only for our business, but for our clients’ businesses and even just for our own personal day-to-day efficiencies. It’s uber important. What’s the best way to schedule tweets and posts? How can I more easily collect email addresses? We’re always answering these questions. So, it was actually pretty disheartening to come to the realization that technology is awesome for businesses, but it’s not so awesome for our client services.

Have you hung out with a millennial lately? We do, every single day. And they’re thumbs are magical. They can do anything with a smartphone and do whatever it is that they’re doing at warp speeds. On average, their texting GWaM (gross words a minute) is over 40 words a minute. Heck, they really don’t even need computers if they have a smartphone. The whole world is in their hands.

While millennials are highly efficient when it comes to multitasking, their people skills are seriously lacking. I’m not saying this is their fault, but it’s basically just the era they were born in. The 1990’s and early 2000’s had a major messaging revolution. After the Internet boom, the smartphone spawned soon after, which then caused email, texting, instant messaging and social media platforms to quickly follow. Suddenly, we were able to keep in touch with people that were 1000s of miles away in just seconds. It beat the shit out of snail mail.

So our staff, I mentioned this above, but they’re basically all a bunch of millennials. They’re cool, creative, and pretty much computer wizards. Our account managers are scheduling posts, assigning design items to our creative team, and writing digital ad copy all at the same time. They can do it all. But what they can’t do is… PICK UP THE PHONE. And it’s a huge disconnect.

I’ve seen it with my own two eyes. A whole project can come to a dead halt because someone does not email back. We’re busy. You’re busy. Grandma is busy. We get it. Emails slip into the spam folder randomly and sometimes (the majority of the time) we just forget to freaking reply. It happens! But while we’re busy being all digital and what not, it doesn’t even cross our minds to pick up the phone and say, “Hey Judy, we sent over that final branding package last week, what did you think?” All you have to do is call.

I don’t know if they’re scared or intimidated by dialing a long strand of numbers, or if it’s just not hardwired into their brains, but it’s got to change. We need to create those close personal connections with clients and picking up the phone is the very first step.","I've seen it with my own two eyes.",2017-11-15,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/technology-killing-client-relationships/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/DISCONNECTED.png,"Technology Is Killing Our Client Relationships","Technology Is Killing Client Our Relationships",,"Technology Is Killing Client Our Relationships",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/DISCONNECTED.png,,Blog,client|digital|killing|millennials|relationships|technology,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,technology-killing-client-relationships,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

1674,"Digital Supplies Qualitative Insight Into Users True Feelings","We’re always busy on election nights, it comes with being a politics and crisis communications agency. And it’s worth knowing something we’ve discovered through monitoring election communications that has implications for political and corporate clients alike.

As election days near, while we monitor and manage our candidates’ digital campaigns, we begin to gain qualitative insight into how things could net out. It’s not a quant thing, in large part because there is not yet a reliable resource for analyzing the political intentions of the U.S. electorate. It’s more of a feeling, a sense driven by the tone and volume of commentary flowing on digital platforms.

Not to say polling and other assessment tools aren’t reliable. But, they don’t capture how people feel at their cores. Social media does.

So whether we’re reviewing organic social content, dark posts, forums or video comments, about two weeks out from an election, things begin to crystalize.

Case in point, we felt something coming ahead of last week’s midterms. The experience was a reminder digital has undoubtedly become the frontline, the tip of the spear, in understanding how people really feel.

The challenge is deciphering it, an intensive, manual process that requires manpower and diligence.

Specifically, digital can tell us how people really feel, just ahead of the election itself. Not months before, or years, but right before the end. It’s as much about timing voter commentary as it is where they share it.

Typically, we’d expect a lot of ‘toxic enthusiasm,’ troll behavior from the people opposing our candidates on, say, Facebook or Instagram throughout the cycle. And this year, there was plenty of that. But there was also a steady, intense parade of commentary from people who were making it clear they intended to vote, and not for Republicans.

There was far less “I’m definitely voting, Republican” than there was “Democrats can count on me.”

The opposition voters made a point over the last two weeks to seek out the Republicans in their districts, and let them know their plans. Or to post similar thoughts in forums, video comments, etc.

It wasn’t an overwhelming flood, more like a pugnacious stream. To the untrained eye, this may seem like gentle trolling. But when you spend as much time as we do researching how the public responds to content, A/B testing, revising and honing, you refine your ability to discern posturing from an actual shift in intention.

Now, no one could predict the specific outcomes that came to pass, particularly in Virginia. But it is fair to say digital can reveal changing tides, maybe even better than polls and pundits.

1679,"It's My Birthday and I Really Need This...","I turned 38 years old today. And while I’m no longer the young crazy guy that I used to be, I still have a ways to go until I’m a senior citizen.

It’s hard watching our parents and grandparents get old. Watching Elizabeth’s grandmother suffer from dementia for years before her passing was devastating to our entire family. That’s why I’m dedicating my birthday and why Elizabeth is dancing for the <a href=""http://thearkofsc.org/"">ARK</a>.

The ARK provides hope and relief to families living with Alzheimer’s Disease or a related Dementia through support services such as respite care, support groups, education, caregiver consultations, resource referrals and community development.

Each year they host a dancing contest - Dancing With The ARK’s Stars - and this year Elizabeth is one of the celebrity dancers. She’ll be dancing the tango. Her goal is to raise $5,000 by February.

I know you can part with $10 today. Maybe even $20. As a birthday gift to me, please <a href=""https://thearkofsc.charityproud.org/Fundraising/P2P/ElizabethDonehue#tabStorysmAnchor"">click here</a> now and help us support our aging neighbors suffering from Alzheimer’s and Dementia.

1684,"The Toughest Time Of The Year, Every Year","This is always the toughest time of the year for me. For the last three years, I have gotten really sick. As the weather changes I also pick up my mileage for marathon season. My immune system gets diminished and I get hit by the little germ factories in my house… the kids. Right now, I write this laying in the bed. My sixth straight day in the bed. I'm going quite stir crazy, so I thought maybe I should finally blog again.

This time of the year is also tough because we’re closing out the books. And I hate talking money. We have to go through the budgets to see what we did right and what we did wrong, so we can set the next year's budgets. We have to hound all of our clients to pay all of their old bills. We have to renew all of our contracts for the following year. We have to set client budgets for the following year. We have to do staff reviews and that always brings up raises. It's the most stressful and worst part of being a business owner. I wish I could just never talk money and only come up with winning strategies and awesome creative.

The health issue and the financial issues aren't completely separate issues. The work stress is probably the biggest detriment on my health. I just go hard until my body collapses. Full throttle is all I know. The demons of my past can't catch me if I'm always running, figuratively and literally.

All this time in bed has given me a lot of opportunity to not only catch up on superhero shows but to also think about about my content. It's so scattered and inconsistent. And it has been for many years.. You guys know how much I love pumping out content but the problem I have is that I'm too interested in too many things. Some days I like to talk about politics. Some days I like to talk about marketing. Some days I like to talk about entrepreneurship. And some days I like to talk about fitness.

But isn't that okay? That just means I'm a real person. I do focus on different things. Why should I try to fake it and be focused on just one thing? That's not me. I should be transparent and authentic in all of my content. As for my readers, some things they will find interesting and some things they won't. What they will always find is the struggles of a real entrepreneur.

Really that is what is missing in the market place. We read and watch enough content about superstars who are balling out. YouTube and the magazine racks are full of those stories. What we don't see are the struggles of the normal everyday entrepreneur. Maybe instead of getting focused, this blog should do the opposite. Maybe it should be unfocused so that you can actually help me get focused. Maybe it should be a place for me to just vent. Sometimes written, sometimes audio and maybe one day I'll get back on the Vlog.

Sidenote: I adore vlogging but the video team has been too slammed to help me. I'm hiring a third video editor now, which will hopefully give us the bandwidth for me to hop back on it.

I don’t mean to be all over the place today. That’s just where the fever has me. Delirious.

What I’m Watching: I just finished <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5675620/"">The Punisher</a> and it was AWESOME. It’s my new favorite Marvel Netflix show.

What I’m Reading:<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-How-Good-Want/dp/0714843377""> It’s Not How Good You Are, It’s How Good You Want To Be</a> by Paul Arden. It’s a very short pocket Bible for creatives.

What I’m Training For: A big goal for 2017 was to PR at the Kiawah Marathon. Unfortunately, it’s now looking like this illness will stop me from running the marathon this coming Saturday. I’m pretty bummed. Next up is the Disney Dopey - a 5k, 10k, half marathon and marathon - 4 straight days - in early January.

What I’m Listening To: <a href=""http://uncivil.show/"">Uncivil</a> podcast by Gimlet Media. It’s about the untold stories of the Civil War.","I'm sick, sidelined and scatterbrained.",2017-12-05,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/toughest-time-year-every-year/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Lets-Talk-2.png,"The Toughest Time Of The Year, Every Year","The Toughest Time Of The Year, Every Year",,"The Toughest Time Of The Year, Every Year",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Lets-Talk-2.png,,Blog,sick|stress|time|toughest|unhealthy|work|year,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,toughest-time-year-every-year,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
1688,"Yes, You Can Hustle Too Hard.","I'm really good at making goals and hitting them.

Set a goal.
Determine the path.
Create a timeline.
Break down the timeline to monthly and weekly milestones.
Break that down into daily to dos.
Stay dedicated.
Measure and pivot when needed.

It’s a pretty simple formula, as long as you can remain firm on point six –stay dedicated. Unfortunately, unforeseen circumstances can jump in the way too late in the game for point seven, measure and pivot, to even matter. That’s when it’s time to uncover the hidden point, point eight –reset and try again.

All year I’ve had a big goal of setting a marathon PR at the Kiawah Marathon on December 9th. That’s this Saturday.

I’ve trained hard for months and I was at the final two steps, run a 20 miler and taper. It was on my 20 miler that I first realized I was getting sick. My heart rate skyrocketed, I was dizzy and I puked twice between hailing an Uber at mile 7. I tried running another five miles that afternoon and then another six the following day (last Tuesday). That six miler was the straw that broke the camel's back. By the time I got home a couple hours later, I was shaking and sweating profusely. I went to bed and woke up at 2 am with a 102.8 degree fever. I’ve been in bed pretty much every hour since.

It’s now one week later and I’m finally up and back to work. I feel better but I feel far from great. My body is weakened and my sinuses are crushed. It’s time to call it. There’s no friggin' way I’m PRing at Kiawah this weekend. And because I can’t PR, there’s no reason to run the race at all. It sucks.

In less than a month, the entire family leaves for our first Disney World trip, where Elizabeth and I will be taking on the Dopey Challenge: a 5k, 10k, half marathon and marathon in four straight days. We’ve dropped a fortune on this trip. It would be stupid of me to try to run Kiawah, kill my immune system even more and not feel great for Disney.

So here I am, totally bummed. I didn’t hit one of my biggest goals for 2017. So point eight it is –reset and try again.

What I’m Watching: <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4396630/"">The Gifted</a> - a new Marvel TV show set in the X-Men universe.

What I’m Listening To: I’m really feeling <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/artist/1M3BVQ36cqPQix8lQNCh4K?autoplay=true"">Shovels and Rope</a> today. I’ve listened to Little Seeds four times already.

What I’m In To: Journaling and meditation. If I can’t train my body right now, I might as well concentrate on training my mind.

What I’m Not Into: Closing out the books for 2017 and concentrating on company financials.

1693,"Merry Christmas, Happy New Year and Nothing But Positive Vibes. I’m Out!","Dear Friends,

It’s time for me to disappear for a few weeks and concentrate on my business and my family. I must deconstruct 2017, figure out what went right, meditate on what went wrong, set the goals and plan for 2018. Then, I’ll spend the holidays with my awesome family before heading to Disney for the Dopey races. I’ll reemerge back on the digital scene in early January. I promise.

So for now... no new blogs. No new VLOGS. And no new videos.

My team will be publishing several 2017 wrap ups with our favorite content from this year. As for me, I'll be in hiding.

This has been one of the best years of my life. Lots of downs, but many, many more ups. I just want to thank each of you for all of your support, love, prayers and positive vibes throughout the year. Seriously, you fuel all the hustle.

Next year is going to be the biggest year yet. I have some extremely huge announcements around my personal content, the Push Digital brand and some new content that's coming soon. Expect all of that as soon as I return in January.

One closing thought...

God made himself man to walk among us as Jesus Christ so that he could bring love and peace to our world. Love and peace, people. I know that some of you reading this may not be Christian. I’m going to guess that the super majority of you are. Or at least that’s what you call yourself.

I fell in love with the Internet and made digital my career because I thought this would be the place where we could all join hands and solve the world’s problems. Instead, it’s become a place that fuels anger and hate.

My final call of 2017 is to ask you to remember why God became man. Take this time of the year to analyze the words coming from your fingertips as you play online. Analyze the tone of your heart. Ask yourself if you are displaying the peace and love God has asked and demanded you to display.

Do you truly love your neighbors? Do you have and display empathy? Does the image of baby Jesus and the words, “Peace on Earth and goodwill toward men,” reflect your general life philosophy?

“Listen to what I say
Pray for peace, people everywhere.
Listen to what I say
A child, a child, sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light.

He will bring us goodness and light.”

1699,"WAIT –How Many Days Did This Year Have?","Man. This has been one heck of a year. I swear it must have had like 500 days in it or something. No seriously, just look at everything we managed to pack in:

<strong>The Brewery</strong>

After many delays and minor frustrations… we finally opened the new Frothy Beard Brewing Company location in West Ashely! The grand opening was absolutely killer and just happened to fall on the same weekend as St. Patrick’s Day and our Fourth Anniversary. It was nuts.

Once the guys started brewing, we quickly realized that our baby 10bbl tanks were not cutting it, so of course we increased the brewery's capacity by adding more tanks. BIGGER TANKS. Three 30 barrels baby. Quadrupling our brewing capacity increased our distribution and just like that it was time to start canning. We really busted ass on this thing.

<strong>The Training</strong>

So I decided to participate in a triathlon with just one small obstacle: I’m a 37 year old man that didn’t know how to swim. Kind of a big thing, right? Yeah and that’s one-third of the tri. Literally it took months for me to eliminate the panic attacks. Basically just started by blowing bubbles and got some coaching from my buddy Chris. It was much harder than I thought, but well worth conquering a fear. After a couple of months, I was actually able to swim well enough to compete in my first Ironman race. It was a half, but only the beginning. This year my training is focused on a full Ironman in September. Gotta get that tattoo.

<strong>Push Digital</strong>

Oh, and for that digital creative agency I founded… 2017 was our biggest and baddest year yet by far. Clients, revenue, staff—growing, growing, growing. Creative…we received notoriety for a SeaWorld video that was ranked as THE BEST TRAVEL AD ON RECORD. And then it was covered by ADWEEK as the Ad Of The Day. Doesn’t get much better than that. Still in shock.

Here’s the big thing for 2018… we are already at max capacity in our new space here and our staffers are practically sitting on top of each other. But I’m fixing it with a bigger and more badass office next door. We’re knocking down walls and taking on big brand names. We’re working with clients and getting inquiries from others that I could only have dreamed of just a few years ago. It’s happening. Push is happening.

The whole thing is insane and I’m psyched.

I’m a lucky man. And I don't just think that on December 31st. All year long I am so thankful for my fantastic wife and children, my staff, our clients, my partners at Frothy and Zombie Bob’s, my F3 brothers and all my other friends. I am blessed. Simple as that.

We have hired more talented folks, signed on more great clients and pumped out more quality content than I wold have thought possible.

My favorite client projects? All of them. But with the space limitations, I had to choose just a few. Enjoy!

Let's start with video. In all honesty, our video team is a bunch  of badasses. From animation to full fledged dramatics, they can take a little bit of content and turn it into a lot. Don't know what I'd do without them.

Then there's our design team. They're practically visual wizards. From branding packages to digital ads and the occasional infographic, all of our content is driven by visual aids and images for socials. So here's some of the best.

1714,"My Favorite Personal Content Of 2017","I've said this before, but December is typically a crazy time in the office. We're wrapping up content calendars and crunching the numbers for next year's budgets, but between all of that and chasing around my precious boys and smoking hot wife, I found a little bit of time to create a new strategy for next year's blog. Don't worry, I'm definitely going to keep pumping out the content... but it could be in a different format. That's all I'm saying cause new content will be here soon enough.

This year though, my blog was all over the place. Which is weird because I'm a super structured and organized individual. Like serial killer status. However, I also like a lot of cool shit and I wanted to share it with y'all. So, you know, here we are. But even though my blog was all over the place, my goal was to just keep it real and be my authentic self. I really wanted to share my struggles, and by doing so, I hope that I helped others who feel like they're constantly under water too. Because we all struggle. Whether it's losing weight or breaking down your business goals, struggle is every where and in every form. More than that though, I was hoping y'all would also keep me accountable. And y'all did. Even when my body was calling it quits, my mind was still running in circles so I continued to put pen to paper. From discussing my entrepreneurial endeavors or just belaboring that fact that I'm addicted to fitness, writing has become way more than just a creative outlet for me. I'm all about transparency and sharing my best and worst self with y'all. And I think I did just that.

Check out a few of my favorite personal pieces from this year.

Every brand needs someone to call when they have royale-with-cheese sized problems. Push is that agency because our world is crisis, we live and breathe it.

Lastly, all of my VLOGS. If I could turn one of these babies out every single day, I would. I'm obsessed. Not with me, but how awesome my team makes them look. Watch the whole playlist<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjfkZBZUQIx36z_2pcFGf7iydd5E0DE6_""> here</a>.

1719,"My Favorite Push Digital Content Of 2017","By now y'all know that my team is a bunch of animals. In a good way, just as long you don't look at our kitchenette. But for real, my team knows how to push out some content. Blogs, infographics, ads, videos, memes, gifs and etc. We do it all. And we do it well. Really freakin' well actually. They're 100% the reason why we're called ""Push Digital"" and not ""Twiddle Our Thumbs Digital.""

This year has been an especially fortunate one for us, well for me, because I've never had a bigger or badass-er (?) team before. We hired a bunch of fresh faces this year, so many we're actually expanding into 3500 square feet next door, in order to keep up with big name brands we've been signing. They require major people power. Believe it or not, we're still hiring. So if you're a creative badass, you're gonna want to shoot us your resume ASAP. Click here.

All of that is just basically to say that I'm proud of my team. 2017 was a year of ceaseless growth, exploration of new mediums and a constant collaboration. We figure out what worked content wise and we were not afraid to try new things. Some times a little too fearless, but thankfully those risks paid off. Check out a few of my favorite Push Digital pieces from 2017:

<strong>Blogs</strong>

The Push Feed introduced a bunch of new blog series this year. We covered our success stories, digital trends, and finally, we decided to put pen to paper and reveal the secret recipe to our specialty: Crisis Communications.

<a href=""http://www.pushdigital.com/corporations-learn-political-campaigns/"">What Corporations Should Learn From Political Campaigns
</a>Recently, we've been picking up a lot of corporate work, which has me realizing one thing: corporations need people like Push. Here's why:

1737,"At Push Digital, We Sprint.","This is actually a topic we’ve written about quite a bit in the past year. But for some reason, the speed at which corporations function is still pretty shocking to us, no matter how many big name brands we pick up. The fact is that crises are inevitable. Whether you’re a celebrity, a major corporation, a politician or even a first grade teacher. At some point in time, you will get punched in the face by a PR nightmare. What do you do? We recommend that you hit the ground running. And you keep running–for months and months and months.

There’s a little saying that goes, “It’s a marathon, not a sprint.” When it comes to Crisis Communications, ignore that phrase 100%. Growing up in the political campaign realm, you come to learn that time is the most precious commodity, so you don’t waste it. You can raise more money. You can recruit more volunteers. You can’t create more time. There is an election date that is set and it’s not moving! Corporations should have the exact same mind set, but they don’t. And I think that’s why the way our company operates is so refreshing for our new clients. We’re sprinters.

In today’s digital age, a lie can become a fact in just seconds, so your team better have the story straight and they better be ready to spill the beans ASAP. Because, almost immediately, your brand reputation has taken a huge hit. You may think, “Oh well, no one really cares about the small strand of salmonella found in our chocolate eggs because we’re a trusted family brand blah blah blaaah...” But that couldn’t be further from the truth. Mommies everywhere will have absolutely no problem writing your name off of their shopping lists, forever. The longer you wait to spread the truth and remedy the mistake, the further your brand falls on the buggy blacklist.

It may have been a little rash to recommend that you completely ignore the above phrase, because truly, Crisis Communications is a little bit of both. When your company is in a crisis, your teams’ butts better be sprinting to tell the truth, to take corrective action and to apologize over and over and over again. However, when it comes to rebuilding your brand, you're in for a content marketing marathon. Your team is pivoting. You sprinted out of the gate and now you’re settling into cruise control with positive content about your brand on every channel. Prepare a long-term content plan and then rub it in your readers’ faces. Every single day. Sure, that salmonella strain was pretty sucky, we admit it… but don’t you remember searching for us in your Easter basket when you were growing up in Newberry, SC? We were there! You loved us. And you still love us… See what we did there?

Moral of the story:  with crisis communications, it’s a marathon AND a sprint. Make sure the person advising you knows how to set the pace.","Empty the tanks.",2018-01-10,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/at-push-we-sprint/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/180109_Wesley_Sprint_482.jpg,"At Push Digital, We Sprint.","At Push Digital, We Sprint.",,"At Push Digital, We Sprint.",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/180109_Wesley_Sprint_482.jpg,,Blog,communications|corporations|crisis|marketing|sprint|time,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,at-push-we-sprint,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
1743,"Zero Excuses","Did a podcast the other day with this ^ as the title. Right up my alley, right? Absolutely.

Kenyon Zitzka was the interviewer—he does personal and business coaching—super cool dude. We had a pretty damn good conversation. You can listen to the episode <a href=""http://kenyonzitzka.com/2017/12/26/balancing-entrepreneurship-fitness-and-family-with-wesley-donehue-discipline-focus-business/"">here</a> OR just keep reading.

Here’s some of what we talked about:

Many of you know I grew up poor. How poor? Section 8 housing, food stamps, Medicaid kind of poor.

The people who only know me as a conservative Republican political strategist and entrepreneur assume I grew up in country clubs. Far from it. You know what they say when you assume...

But I’ll say this. My mother used government assistance the way it was meant to be used—temporarily. She went to cosmetology school and learned to cut hair. She was raising me and my sister by herself (after divorcing my abusive father) and she knew she would have to work hard at a decent job to support us. And so she did.

My introduction to politics happened around that time. In fact, it was a redistricting proposal (to send all of us poor kids to the same school) and I spoke out at a School Board meeting about it. Literally, I became the “face” of the issue. I also met a state senator in between 8th and 9th grade. That was a really big deal for me, even bigger when he contacted me about working for him. You mean, you can get paid for doing politics? (Light bulb.)

After high school, I went to the University of South Carolina as an engineering major. That’s another Wesley you may not know—Nerd Wesley. Star Trek Wesley. Whatever, you actually do know him. But I hate math. And I hated engineering... so I switched to political science. Then never looked back.

Ran for USC Republican Chair and State Republican Chair. Basically, my goal was to work on every campaign I could get my hands on.

Generally, people are drawn to politics for a cause. For me, that was believing (and hoping) I could actually make a difference. Me. Section 8 kid. Working in the statehouse. Where people make THE LAWS.

After college, I worked at a few different political firms, then got the entrepreneurial bug and started my own place. When I made a little more money, I hired my first employee. Made more, so I hired the second one. I've always been a firm believer in spending money to make money. And as hard as it's been to pass off my baby, I've got my own babies at home so I got over it real quick.

Last week we officially hired number 40. Oh. And we work on a lot more than just politics now. We have several corporate clients and pump out a lot more issue advocacy work, brand reputation and crisis communications. Those last two are our specialties these days.

Some of our clients are Marco Rubio, SeaWorld, Sears and Kmart.

And now we have, in my opinion, the sickest office in the state... possibly the Southeast. While we're sitting on top of each at the moment, cause we're expanding in the 3500 square feet next door, at least our staffers get a brewery and a pizza kitchen to hold them over. Could be worse...

Just ask the poor kid.","Got candid with Kenyon.",2018-01-11,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/1743-2/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ZeroExcuses.png,"Zero Excuses","Zero Excuses",,"Zero Excuses",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ZeroExcuses.png,,Blog,business|entrepreneur|excuses|podcast|Politics|zero,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,1743-2,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

E and I decided to compete in the Disney Dopey, which is a four day race (5K, 10K, Half Marathon &amp; Full Marathon). But we had an absolute blast. Disney knows how to organize and keep people energized. We were running in the early morning and then chasing the kids around the parks during the day. By day four we were both mentally and physically exhausted but we rocked it.

Check out my AAR which is WAAAAAAAAY longer than usual. I decided to cut this video because the blogs I read and videos I watched before the race really helped me. I hope this can help some of you training for the races.

1752,"No One Watches My YouTube Videos And I Don't Care","This question popped on my Youtube channel this morning so I wanted to address it. Because... you know... he’s right. No one watches my YouTube videos. No one.

[caption id=""attachment_1753"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""600""]<img class=""wp-image-1753"" src=""http://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_0106.jpg"" alt=""youtube comment"" width=""600"" height=""450"" /> <em>This guy ain't wrong... but here's why I'm right.</em>[/caption]

Here’s the truth - I fundamentally believe that I built my company on content. I didn’t have a lot of national connections. I didn’t have partners funneling business to me for kickbacks. I never wanted to make round through the DC circuit and kiss ass at happy hours every evening. I had to show that I knew what I was talking about by actually talking about it. At the same time, I had to prove that I was right by showing results. And I did that through content.

Today we pump out far more content than any of our competitors and I’m also pumping out a lot of personal content on a daily basis. So when you look at the raw YouTube views, you probably think I’m wasting my time. But frankly, I don’t really give a damn about YouTube.

Personally, I watch A TON of YouTube and it’s actually my preferred social network. I spend way more time there than I do Facebook, Instagram or Twitter combined. But while I consume a ton of content there, it’s not necessarily the platform for the audience I’m trying to reach.

I reach my audience in <strong>two way</strong>s:

<strong>Facebook.</strong> I get thousands of views on each video because I put money behind them and target audiences who need a digital agency like Push. I can reach that audience cheaper on Facebook than I can on YouTube. We actually do a little advertising on YouTube also, but those paid numbers won’t be reflected in our organic views.

<strong>Email.</strong> I have cultivated a large email list. I embed the YouTube videos into blog posts and then link those blog posts in emails. That’s where most of those YouTube views come from.

My videos don’t rank high on YouTube. No one finds them organically. I’ve never spent the time on my videos to get them ranked higher like I do for our clients. I don’t need to. I’m not trying to reach the masses. I’m trying to reach a few select targets. And in that scenario –I’m <em>effing</em> killing it.","A troll with some truth.",2018-01-24,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/no-one-watches-my-youtube-video-and-i-dont-care/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_0106.jpg,"No One Watches My YouTube Videos And I Don't Care","No One Watches My YouTube Video And I Don't Care",,"No One Watches My YouTube Video And I Don't Care",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_0106.jpg,,Blog,comment|Content|creative|videos|views|youtube,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,no-one-watches-my-youtube-video-and-i-dont-care,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16
1755,"Fire and Fury: Michael Wolff Wrote the Dems’ 2018 Midterm Playbook","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The 2018 midterm election season has just begun, and already it’s promising to be one of the ugliest races in American history. There are many reasons for this, but the most recent is certainly the publication of Michael Wolff’s book, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many parts of the book have been widely discredited, furthering confusion and eroding trust in journalism. Regardless, the end result is things will be harder for Republicans, who control both the House, Senate, and governor’s seats. I know this because running digital political campaigns are a core part of what we do at Push, and the book is essentially a fishbowl of one-liners perfectly written to knock Republican candidates down a peg or three. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When the president’s party is in control of the House and Senate, it automatically does two things. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First, it makes each candidate (whether it’s a senator, representative or governor) a proxy for the president. They have to align themselves with the president or risk losing much-needed support from the White House. How can a candidate hope to help their constituents if the president doesn’t agree with their politics? </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Second, it puts the controlling party on the defensive. Any conservative legislation will become a rallying cry for democrats.  </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a for instance, take the tax bill. Democrats will rail against the bill in their campaigns, how it robbed Main Street and lined Wall Street’s pockets. It will be a central theme, right up there with healthcare, infrastructure, immigration, national security. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So, republicans will be on the defensive. Add to that a scorcher like </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fire and Fury</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and the ante has been upped dramatically. The primary effect the book will have is to codify the narrative that the president isn’t fit for office. And by proxy, neither are any republican candidates who support him. It will remind Americans that there’s discord everywhere, from his team in the White House to the House, Senate and even the governor’s association. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Take the notion that President Trump’s inner circle doesn’t believe in him, or more worryingly, didn’t think he was going to win. The book alleges that even the president himself didn’t think a victory was possible. The social copy for dems writes itself; “The president didn’t think he would win, and now he’s the leader of the free world. Let’s not empower him by giving up more seats in the (house/senate/governor’s office).” </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Or put another way; “Republicans don’t support the president, neither should you.” </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mental fitness is a central theme to the book, and questions of the president’s capacity to lead abound. For instance, the idea that he isn’t smart prompted what will certainly become one of the president’s most infamous tweets, in which he calls himself a “stable genius.” </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That he used the phrase himself opens dems up to put the quote next to any issue their party members dislike. “The stable genius’ tax bill wasn’t so smart after all.” Or, “Only a ‘stable genius’ would think a wall between the US and Mexico is a good idea.” </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The stockpile of ammunition grows taller by the page. He doesn’t process information well; he repeats himself word for word multiple times over a ten minute period; there is more backstabbing in the White House than your average reality TV show. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The list goes on. And while the book will certainly provide political campaigners of all stripes (from TV to digital and everything in between), digital is where it will be put to use most fervently. Why? As we learned in 2016, A/B testing wins elections. Volumes of content will pour through your Facebook feed, attempting to coax you into a like, comment, share and ultimately, a vote. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This content will spread far and wide via social, codifying party-line democrats. But that’s not the problem. The real issue is it will get in front of centrists, swing and non voters, bringing them ever-closer to voting democrat. This is what republican campaigns are going to have to deal with, and why 2018 will be one of the ugliest races in American history. </span>","Centrists, swing and non voters are in trouble.",2018-01-23,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/fire-fury-michael-wolff-wrote-dems-2018-midterm-playbook/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Untitled-design-29.png,"Fire and Fury: Michael Wolff Wrote the Dems’ 2018 Midterm Playbook","Fire and Fury: Michael Wolff Wrote the Dems’ 2018 Midterm Playbook",,"Fire and Fury: Michael Wolff Wrote the Dems’ 2018 Midterm Playbook",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Untitled-design-29.png,,Blog,"2018|american|book|discredited|election|fire|fury|michael wolff",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,fire-fury-michael-wolff-wrote-dems-2018-midterm-playbook,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-16

1772,"Trey Gowdy Is The Best Congressman In America","Congressman Trey Gowdy is a client. He has been for a long time. I worked on his first congressional campaign and today I serve as his chief digital strategist.

FUN FACTS:

1 Trey Gowdy raises more money online than any other congressman. (At least that’s what we’re told). He could literally send out an email that says “What’s up? Sincerely, Trey Gowdy” with a donate button and raise $25,000.
2 Trey Gowdy ranks as one of the most popular politicians in South Carolina. The guy’s numbers would make you believe he walks on water.
3 Trey Gowdy is the most popular politician in his district. That’s one of the most conservative districts in America.

One would read these fun facts and automatically assume that Trey is part of the fringe. He’s a political beast who tosses out red meat for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He’s in lockstep with President Trump on everything.

Yet this is Trey Gowdy...
<p style=""text-align: center;""><iframe style=""border: none; overflow: hidden;"" src=""https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpushdigitalinc%2Fvideos%2F1650559311653613%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=476"" width=""476"" height=""476"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
Keeping in mind that Trey is a “no bullshit, do what’s right for the country, screw Washington games, results before party, the ends don’t justify the means” politician AND he raises a ton of cash while remaining one of the most popular politicians at home and perhaps even in the nation, you have to ask — why don’t more politicians adopt his attitude?

You know the answer. Because most politicians care too much about being in Washington and you can’t have it both ways. You can’t have that “no Washington games” attitude while also working to stay in office forever in order to climb that ladder up the hill.

For years, Trey has been complaining to everyone who would listen how much he hates Washington. He didn’t want to be there. He could not care less if he was re-elected. And that’s what makes him the best Congressman in America.

Americans are going to get the elected officials we deserve. Go on the internet for 13 seconds and you know we don’t deserve people like Trey Gowdy who just want to solve problems. We’re way more interested in throwing shit than in solving problems.","Gowdy come back!",2018-02-06,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/trey-gowdy-best-congressman-america/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/180206_Wesley_Trey_Gowdy_482-1.jpg,"Trey Gowdy Is The Best Congressman in America","Trey Gowdy Is The Best Congressman in America",,"Trey Gowdy Is The Best Congressman in America",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/180206_Wesley_Trey_Gowdy_482-1.jpg,,Blog,"america|Best|Congressman|Trey Gowdy",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,trey-gowdy-best-congressman-america,,default,0,0,0,open,open,2018-02-19

6308,"A Government That Pushes And Rewards Hard Work","I’ve been having an identity crisis lately. I own a Republican digital agency. I’ve been working for the Republican Party since I was fifteen years old. I spent my college years and my entire adult life helping build the Republican Party. But now I look at recent debates and I ask myself “am I still a Republican?”

It’s a hard question to answer, but there is an easier one to answer - why did you BECOME a Republican?

In this podcast interview with Zero Xcuses I give that answer. Put simply, I am a Republican because I grew up surviving on government handouts - Section 8 housing, welfare, Medicaid and food stamps. If not for government, my mom, sister and I would have been on the streets. But while government helped us survive, I also saw that it trapped my neighbors in a system in which they could not escape. They became dependent. You hear politicians talk about “a hand up and not a hand out.” I believe that, but when I say it, I’m not just giving you a cliche talking point. I’m giving you a direct observation and life lesson.

There are two stories. There is the story of my mom, who used government for a few years, went to school to become a cosmetologist, got a job and got off the system. Then there is my dad who used government checks as an excuse not to work. He watched TV all day, became lazy and bored and then turned to drugs. As he laid on his deathbed the doctor told me “it wasn’t the cancer that killed him. The meth took his immune system.”

Here’s what I believe...

I believe in helping people when they truly need help. I believe in a system that pushes and rewards hard work. I believe we must not trap people in a system that empowers them to fail at life. As long as the Republican Party believes that and acts on it, I am still a Republican. When the party leaves me, I will leave the party.

6332,"How I Built A Badass Digital Agency","They say the best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time. That's how I grew Push Digital into a 42 person badass machine - one staffer at a time over seven years.

I didn't start with cash in the bank. No large investments and a crazy hiring spree. No fancy office. I started with one $500 a month client and a dream.

I made just enough money to pay the bills at home. Nothing big, somewhere around $30,000. Instead of paying myself more when I made more, I hired my first staffer. Part time at first and then full time. Then I hired another. Then another. Then another. Finally around my seventh staffer I gave myself a small $10,000 raise. Then I hired more.

It has never been about putting money in my pocket today. It's always been about the dream - building a long term sustainable company.

Here's my advice to budding entrepreneurs: forget the fancy suits, cars and boats. Put on a hard hat and build, build, build. That's what I did. And that's what I'm doing.

6340,"The Coolest Digital Agency Office In America, Maybe THE WORLD","Michael and I were sitting on a Charleston beach, beers in hand while taking a break from a game of bocce ball. We started talking about the kind of company I wanted to build. I say “I” because this was before Michael even joined the team. In fact, this was the conversation where that subject was first broached.

“You know what would be badass? If I put Push Digital inside of a brewery. Even Google doesn’t have that,” I said.

Admittedly, it was a pretty dumb idea. How would that make any sense at all? Well... I’ll tell you how it would make sense - if you actually owned the brewery.

Years later the dream was realized when I invested into Frothy Beard Brewing Company and Zombie Bob’s Pizza. Both needed a new space and Push was expanding. Why the heck wouldn’t we put them all in one place?

6348,"The Explosion of Craft Beer in South Carolina","How did we go from being one of the least craft beer friendly states to one of the best states in the nation for craft beer? How did we explode from six to fifty-two breweries in about six years? Four laws and teamwork.

In 2007, the badasses at Coast Brewing Company in Charleston led the legislative fight to increase the 5% ABV cap to 17.5% ABV, which gave the industry the ability to really open up craft beer styles to the state. To put that into perspective, we have eighteen beers on tap today at Frothy Beard Brewing. Only six are 5% or lower.

The law solidified Jaime and Dave of Coast as the true pioneers of South Carolina craft beer.

It was about that time that I started falling in love with craft beer. I visited every craft brewery around the nation that I could and kept wondering why we in South Carolina couldn’t have what North Carolina has. I met Jaime and she explained our antiquated laws and how the biggest hindrance is that they couldn’t sell pints or growlers on premises. They were limited to small samples. Since I worked in the South Carolina Senate and I got a ton of House members elected, I thought I could use my connections to make a difference.

Jaime and I teamed up with attorney and craft beer loving freak Brooke Bristow and our little trio went head to head with some of the most powerful lobbyists in the state. Brooke handled the legal aspect. Jaime riled up the brewers and grassroots. I worked the legislative game. With no money, no lobbyists, no real craft beer association - and with the amazing help of Senator Sean Bennett and Representative Derham Cole (both craft beer nerds) - we (literally) snuck through The Pint Law, allowing craft breweries to sell pints and growlers directly to customers in their taproom. To put that into perspective, about 85% of Frothy Beard’s income comes from on-premises sales so you can see why that allowed was the spark that created the craft beer explosion.

The next step came when we heard that Stone Brewing Company, based in San Diego, CA, wanted to open an east coast operation and South Carolina was an option. I knew that South Carolina legislators didn’t care about beer, but they did care about jobs. So we used the opportunity to get the next thing we wanted; the ability to serve food and unlimited beer on premises (the Pint Law only allows for three pints), both of which Stone would want if they were to move here.

The band got back together, with lobbyist Sarah Hazzard joining in on the fun. Chris Brown from Holy City, John Bauknight from RJ Rockers and Will McCameron from Brewery85 all worked their asses off. We launched the South Carolina Beer Jobs campaign, and the distributors, on behalf of the big beer companies, went ape shit. At one point, they had eighteen powerful lobbyists at the South Carolina Statehouse and we had Sarah, Brooke, and me. We weren’t just David vs Goliath. We were like Fraggles against Goliath. But this wasn’t about craft beer. This was about jobs. That’s the only thing I’d let our team talk about. If we just offered huge incentives to lure Boeing, we should change two silly little laws to lure Stone, especially given that tourism is our top industry.

Push Digital launched a digital campaign flooding Statehouse offices with calls and emails. Jaime got the craft beer community doing the same. I called in every favor I could. Sarah worked her magic and pulled off a hat-trick in the House. And somehow, we won! Now, a South Carolina brewery can have a restaurant, and if they do, they can serve as much beer to a customer as the customer can handle.

Last year, we took one more small step on behalf of brewpubs like Edmund’s Oast and Hunter-Gatherer by passing a law allowing brewpubs to distribute their beer. Just this week, Edmund’s Oast beers hit taps and shelves, something that could not have happened just a year ago.

That’s progress. So, what’s next?

Organization. I’ve helped pass three laws by calling in favors with no paid lobbyist and no official association structure. That ends today. Not because I don’t love this community and won’t help, but because it’s time for a few people to stop carrying all the water and for all those who benefit to step up.

If the craft beer industry in South Carolina wants any more progress, every brewery needs to become paying members of the South Carolina Brewers Guild. The Guild needs to hire a lobbyist who can be at the Statehouse every day. Brewers are known for being chill as hell. That’s why I love them. But sometimes you can be too chill. If any more progress is to be made, it will require fighters.

A lot of people worked their asses off to build this industry, but the people I want to call out specifically, most of whom I already named, are:

Jaime Tenny
Dave Merritt
Sean Bennett
Derham Cole
Paul Campbell
Sarah Hazzard
Brooke Bristow
Chris Brown
MIchael Biondi
John Bauknight
Will McCameron

6353,"Where Does Your Motivation Come From?","Motivation can come from a lot of different places. Some folks are running to something. Others are running from something.

I talk a lot about setting goals here on my blog, to my staff and to my clients. Yet when it comes to my personal and family goals, and to a small part even my business goals, I’m not running to something. I’m running from something. That’s where my motivation comes from. That’s why I’m always moving.

My parents and my step-father died pretty young. Two of my best friends, Connie and Derrick, both died way too young. That showed me how short life can be. Life is too short to waste in front of a TV. Sure, I watch the occasional movie and even occasionally binge a Netflix show, but you won’t find me sitting in front of a TV for hours every day like way too many Americans.

Here’s something that's been really bothering me lately. Let me get all defensive for a minute...

I recently learned that when some of my competitors are pitching business against me, the attack they use against Push Digital is that I personally spend more time working out or drinking beer than I do concentrating on my clients. You see... that’s the bullshit I’m talking about. I out work every single one of my competitors. That’s my super power. I can embrace the suck and the stress more than anyone I know. I do mean ANYONE. I’m able to give my clients the attention they deserve AND do those other things because I don’t sit on my ass in front of a TV all night like most people. My down time is still my up time. I’m sorry that my Instagram feed is way more full of roads and gyms than me sitting in front of my computer. I thought the latter was pretty damn boring. And by the way, owning a brewery doesn’t mean I sit around and drink beer all day. In fact, now that I own a brewery I drink about half the amount that I did. Beer is now business. And I work my ass off at it.

Ok, now that I’ve sounded all defensive, which by the way... I AM, here’s a great new clip from my interview with Zero Xcuses...

6360,"Brad Parscale’s Rise In The Trump Campaign Is A Very Big Deal","The Republican digital agency sphere is pretty small. I know most of the players. While we’ve all worked against each other for the better part of a decade, we’ve all worked with each other in the fight to prove digital’s place in political campaigns. Brad Parscale, the biggest name in digital politics right now, I’ve never met. I’ve never talked to him. He probably doesn’t know who I am. The dude came out of nowhere. Yet, he’s done something the rest of us have been unable to do. He hasn’t just put digital front and center in a large campaign. He’s literally taken over the biggest campaign in the world, the President’s re-elect.

Frankly, I’ve had my beef with articles detailing the Trump digital campaign. I didn’t at all agree with the articles claiming the Trump Facebook strategy was innovative. Maybe there was something behind the scenes that we aren’t seeing, but the point that targeting a ton of niche audiences with niche content on Facebook is nothing new. We do it on every campaign we work on and we’ve done it for a couple cycles now. If anything, Parscale had the financial resources to target MORE audiences with MORE messages. Truly, that’s badass. But it’s not an innovative strategy like so many reporters have pointed out. I mean, not that they know what they’re talking about. They’re the same reporters who claim that digital agencies make tens-of-millions of dollars without knowing our explaining that our agencies serve as a pass-through for advertising dollars.

Nevertheless, I’m a Parscale fan and I know what he’s done is good for our party and our industry. I, along with the leadership of agencies like Targeted Victory, Harris Media, Prosper Group, IMAGE and others have been in the trenches fighting for every dollar we can get allocated to digital. The TV guys fought back, refusing to admit that digital was on the rise. Every dollar taken away from their line item was a few cents taken out of their pockets. As soon as they could no longer claim that digital wasn’t worth the investment, they began bringing digital in-house so they could get those dollars too. They’ve been screwing us over for years.

Then comes Parscale, an outsider with a direct line to a candidate with a lot of money, who hasn’t had to put up with all the bullshit. He was in the right place at the right time and picked up a candidate that did not carry the same baggage as the other general and TV consultants that he had been fighting for a decade. It was the perfect storm for a man like Pascale. He was able to not only prove the merits of digital, but to also climb the ladder and gain real leadership on this team. Frankly, that’s something I have personally been unable to do because in 99% of Republican political campaigns, digital teams are still put at the kids' table. We get no dollars, no say so and all the blame when the candidate decides to Google his/her name and doesn’t see the results he/she expects. Hell, I just jumped off of a campaign two weeks ago because of this crapfest.

That’s what I appreciate about Parscale. It’s not because of some innovative strategy. It’s because, somehow, he’s been able to do what the rest of us have been trying to do. He’s taken over and proved what digital investments can do.

I’m told by common friends that Parscale is one of the hardest working folks in the business. They say he’s incredibly intelligent, personable and he has the knack for being able to sway people. I’m told by folks at the major digital companies that he listens to their advice, where the Clinton campaign acted like they knew everything and were the smartest folks on the planet. They say that Parscale concentrated on moving small audiences he knew could flip swing states, while the Clinton digital teams were more interested in the businesses they could open after their big win. That’s the way this game is supposed to work. Win first. Then cash out.

The Trump campaign, under Parscale’s guidance, proved that with a heavy investment AND an intense focus on digital, campaigns can move the targeted audiences they need to win. With Parscale taking over the reins of our party’s top campaign, let's hope that many more Republican campaigns follow suit and put a digital pro at the helm.",,2018-03-07,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/brad-parscales-rise-trump-campaign-big-deal/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/180306_Wesley_Blog_Brad_350-1.jpg|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/180306_Wesley_Blog_Brad_350.jpg,"parscale|brad parscale","parscale|brad parscale",|,"parscale|brad parscale",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/180306_Wesley_Blog_Brad_350-1.jpg,,Blog,,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,brad-parscales-rise-trump-campaign-big-deal,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-03-07

6374,"The Long Goodbye, A Personal Request From Me To You","I’ve seen a lot of death. It’s always been close to me. Parents, best friends, both expected and very unexpected. One minute they’re here. Then they’re not.

Yet, that’s not always the case.

They call Alzheimer’s and Dementia, “the long goodbye.”  The person you knew so well doesn’t leave in a moment. They disappear gradually over time. You have to sit and watch as they forget their lives, they forget you and eventually they forget themselves. Then you can’t sit and watch anymore because you have to actively take care of them as they forget how to take care of themselves. Eventually, their organs forget how to function and you can finally say goodbye.

Elizabeth’s grandmother, Birdi Lou Harlowe, died four years ago after a long battle with Dementia. Birdi was the right name for a woman who was full of life and who would fly around a room with a smile on her face, energy in her lungs and love in her heart. Watching her become someone else took it’s toll on Elizabeth and her family, on our family.

When asked to be a celebrity dancer for the Dancing With The ARK’s Stars Elizabeth immediately jumped at the chance because the best way to honor “Mimi” is to help other families going through what we went through. The ARK is a Summerville, SC-based organization that offers support to families affected by Alzheimer’s and Dementia.

Elizabeth has been working her tail off for this event. I jokingly say that I’m ready for it to be over because it’s all she talks about! She spends hours every week learning the tango and she’s only a few hundred dollars away from meeting her fundraising goal. We only have four more days until the big event.

That’s why I’m writing today. I need you to open up your wallet, pull out your credit card and donate $10 today. I’ve already ponied up and donated $500. Will you join me in donating just $10 BEFORE SATURDAY NIGHT’S EVENT? <a href=""http://bit.ly/VoteElizabeth"">Just click Here.</a>

6391,"The Most Uncomfortable Part of Being An Entrepreneur","Taking on so many different endurance events has taught me that pain will always be there. It doesn’t get any easier. The best it will ever be is uncomfortable. The goal isn’t to stop it from being uncomfortable. That’s called sitting on the couch and watching Netflix. The goal is to get comfortable being uncomfortable.

Being an entrepreneur is a lot like that. It’s very uncomfortable. And I find that the most uncomfortable part of the whole thing is trusting other people with your business and letting go. It’s my baby. I conceived it. I birthed it. Now, it’s like dropping my kid off on the first day of school and just expecting someone to take care of him the way I take care of him –with all your heart, soul and mind.

The truth is that no one will ever love it the way I love it. But that doesn’t mean other folks are automatically bad stewards of my company. They will work hard for me. But trust, oh trust, is so hard for them to gain.

I can hold on and squeeze with all my might but that only leads to one outcome –failure. For me, failure means stagnation. Not moving forward. Not growing.

I can’t manage 42 people. I can, however, manage 5 people and they can manage 5 people and they can manage 5 people. It’s all about letting go and delegating. That’s what I talk about in this clip with Zero Xcuses...

6400,"Pushing Positive Vibes To You","Recently, I sat down with Kenyon for his Zero Xcuses podcast and he asked me what’s up with all the POSITIVE VIBES all over my social media accounts. The answer is simple. It’s to cast away the cesspool of negativity that's surrounding me and killing my mood and the productivity of my team.
<p style=""text-align: center;""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/145lqFRbzUQ"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
For the last several years, I’ve been a shamefully unhappy person. It sickens me to think about it because this kid from the ghetto has so much great shit to be thankful for. My smoking hot wife, my beautiful baby boys and all of my entrepreneurial enterprises. I am #blessed beyond being.

Many of you reading this will understand but as an entrepreneur… my work isn’t just Monday through Friday from 9 to 5. My mind is always thinking about high-level strategy for my clients. Are we going to make payroll? What’s the flip is up with our office expansion? My mind is a business machine 24/7 and 365.

I’m unhappy because I am surrounded by literally so much effing negativity. The news is negative. Facebook is negative. And even our clients can be negative —which makes my employees negative. This is unfortunate because often times I find myself bringing my negativity home, which is not ok.

Here’s the catch: it’s still my job to grow audiences. For our political candidates and advocacy clients, we work to attract more followers, and then to push (get it?) those people to action—to volunteer, to vote, to donate, to contact a legislator, to side with us on a bill. Makes sense?

We do this with creative content that gets people interested and involved. And you want to know what isn’t working? Positivity. What works? Anger. The current state of American politics is depression inducing negativity. Sure, we could do an ad or write a blog supporting our troops overseas. People love a good soldier coming home story, but right now the new rhetoric is anti-immigration, building dystopian-style walls, and slapping sex scandals in people’s faces.

It’s sad, but it’s true—right now, everything that works online is negative. Because right now, that’s what the people want. And it’s hurting me deeply to serve it up and to be a participant in an atmosphere of vitriol. I did not get into this business to be a fear monger. But there is a HORRIBLE negative vibe in this country right now—and it’s been coming from both sides for some time now.

So, I’m putting my foot down. If news and political strategies ain’t changing, I sure as hell am. For my health, for my office’s aura, and most importantly for my family. I encourage everyone else (and myself) to give off ONLY positive vibes. I start each day that way. I hope and trust and believe things will change. Yes. Change for the better.
I’m positive about it.",,2018-03-12,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/pushing-positive-vibes-to-you/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/180308_Push_Wesley_Vibes_964x482.jpg,"Pushing Positive Vibes To You","Pushing Positive Vibes To You",,"Pushing Positive Vibes To You",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/180308_Push_Wesley_Vibes_964x482.jpg,,Blog,"Charleston|entrepreneur|lifestyle|positive|positive vibes|push digital|pushing|vibes",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,pushing-positive-vibes-to-you,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-03-12
6404,"Saving Stores With Experiences","I was a pitiful teenager. While my friends were out smoking weed or learning how to drink, I was stalking the shelves at Toys R Us for the newest Star Trek and Star Wars toys. I was a real Toys R Us kid. Refusing to grow up as the commercials sang. That really confused my wife when we married and I brought boxes of action figures to our new home.

I was sad to see Toys R Us announced that all of their stores are closing, yet another victim of the new digital world. Having just wrapped up months of work for K-mart and Sears, we know the story all too well.

Just two days ago I stepped into Target for three items. None of them were there. I pulled up my Amazon App, purchased all three and then told my wife that I am done shopping at stores. She just called to say that two of the three items already arrived today.

That’s why Toys R Us is joining all the stores that used to line shopping malls. But it didn’t have to be that way. One word could have saved them –EXPERIENCES.

The experience matters and for brick and mortar retailers, the experience is everything. I own a craft brewery in Charleston, SC. The craft beer nerds come for the beer. The much broader population comes for the experience, to meet the people making the beer, for our awesome kids’ center and for our total geeky vibe. Our taproom and deck go from crowded to flooded when we throw a big party (ex: wrestling, oyster roasts, trivia) because people are looking for things to do and not just for food to eat and for stuff to buy.

I am the proud father of two boys. We are always looking for stuff to do. It is almost too easy to come up with ideas for Toys R US. Here are ten ideas my team came up within just two minutes!
<ol>
 	<li>Lego Tournament: leave the kits at home folks, it's time for the kids to go old school and freestyle with piles and piles of lego pieces.</li>
 	<li>Paw Patrol: let your local animal shelter join in on the family fun with a day of play with furry (and adoptable) friends.</li>
 	<li>Candy Land: turn your store into a sweet and sour obstacle course. Not all candy characters are as sweet as they seem...</li>
 	<li>Pirate Party: scour the seven seas, meet mermaids, and search for hidden treasure and prizes throughout the store.</li>
 	<li>Video Game Tournament: We're playing for keeps! Plug in and test out the latest in gaming for the ultimate prize.</li>
 	<li>Laser Tag: Dodge, duck, and dive behind barriers and battle it out with your family and friends.</li>
 	<li>Easy Bake Oven Cook-Off: Can your kiddos handle the heat? BYOK (Bring Your Own Kitchen) to an Easy Bake Oven Cook-Off, where you can have your cake and eat it too.</li>
 	<li>Safari With Stuffed Animals: Come to the safest (and softest) safari in town! Where cobras are cuddly and giraffes are still relatively giant.</li>
 	<li>Jedi Training With Lightsaber Duels: May the force be with you during this once in a life time Jedi training.</li>
 	<li>Super Hero Day: Dress up as your favorite superhero and unleash your powers to help you grab as many goodies as possible.</li>
</ol>
Not only would these ideas fill stores and provide a quick income boost, they would also build a loyal customer base. Sure, it is hard, but going out of business is a lot harder.

Every year, hundreds of Charleston-area families turnout for <a href=""https://wonderworkstoys.com/blog/post/elfstravaganza-2017/"">Elfstravaganza</a>, an event hosted by Wonderworks and owned by my friend Christine Osborne.

6425,"Push Digital Just Leveled Up And I Love It","<p dir=""ltr"">For the past couple of weeks, my team has been teasing the world with elements of our rebranding process and I’m so stoked to announce that our new website and branding package are finally LIVE. It’s done. It’s badass. It’s beautiful. It’s clean. Go take a look. Right now! GO. I mean it. <a href=""https://pushdigital.com/"">Click here.</a></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ah, there are just no words for how much I love Push Digital’s new experience. And that’s exactly what this exercise was – an experience. From beginning to end, for everyone involved, this whole process was an experience. Not to take away from the magnitude of what our creative and production teams accomplished in the last couple of months, but this kind of touches on something I’ve talked about a lot when it comes to being an entrepreneur.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For a long time, practically since the beginning, I was the only one who produced the content. Here and there I had help, but it’s something I have taken ownership of and something I just plain like to do. Doesn’t hurt that I’m pretty damn good at it either. However, I thoroughly believe that content is the driving force behind the Push Digital machine. Even our business development plan practically thrives and survives on it. Recently, I’ve taken a bit of a step back from the Push Digital content calendar to focus on my personal stuff. Was it hard as hell (because this company is my baby)? Bet your ass it was. But from the mouth of an entrepreneur, who always has business on the brain, this is the single biggest step towards <em>real</em> growth.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">You don't just add an account manager here or a developer there. Your goal should be to surround yourself with people who care about what you’re trying to do as much as you do. Do I always feel like that is the case? If I’m being totally honest, no. But to me, this rebranding process reinforces in my mind that Push Digital is the company that I’ve always wanted it to be. Also, I'm truly surrounded by people who actually freaking care. It's days like today that just make all the stress of being an entrepreneur 100% worth it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Back to the internal accolades, I just want to throw some serious credit to every single pair of hands that helped on this project. It started out with a company-wide survey that trickled into several brainstorming sessions. And then once the foundation was laid, my crew got to work. The creative team made design magic, developers coded their butts off and account managers created content calendars. So here we are today… looking at a bomb new website that encompasses everything I’ve ever envisioned for Push Digital.</p>

6447,"The Truth About Cambridge Analytica And Your Privacy","Let me tell you a story…

In 2013, I built a really badass Facebook app for Ken Cuccinelli’s bid for Virginia Governor. At the time, it was a monument to my love of social media and just plain savvy as a political strategist. Never afraid to push the boundaries of technology, it proved to be an early and effective tool in weaponizing social media for the sake of politics.

Just a few months prior, the Obama campaign built a targeted sharing app that allowed a person to sign in using their Facebook account and then pull in all of their friends who they could then send a specific message based on the location of that friend. <a href=""http://swampland.time.com/2012/11/20/friended-how-the-obama-campaign-connected-with-young-voters/"">Time</a> wrote, “More than 600,000 supporters followed through with more than 5 million contacts, asking their friends to register to vote, give money, vote or look at a video designed to change their mind.”

That’s a big deal because when a person gave the app permission to access their Facebook data, they were also giving the app permission to access their friends’ data without their friends giving permission themselves. It was all part of Facebook’s Open Graph.

I took it all another step. This is from a memo I wrote in 2013:

“In 2012, Facebook’s targeted sharing application was a game-changer for the Obama campaign. No marketing technique proved to be more effective than peer-to-peer messaging. Obama staffers even went so far as to say that the application was their most innovative technological development. We can take their model to the next level by merging it with the RNC voter file, Cuccinelli field IDs, and microtargeting data.

The idea is simple: have supporters share messages with their friends that are specifically tailored to each individual friend, instead of broad, generic messaging. Each issue message should include a call-to-action coordinated with field staff activities.”

Let’s say that Erin is friends with George. Erin logged on to the app and it pulled in all the information about George that Facebook would give me. We matched George to the voter file and then to our microtargeting data, which told us which issues George cared about the most. In this case, George is a hardcore pro-lifer. Instead of Erin sending a generic message to George about Cuccinelli and jobs, Erin sent George a message about Ken Cuccinelli being a national leader in the pro-life movement. That’s what my app did.

We built the app and it worked beautifully. I can’t say that it was a game-changer, but on election night the race was much closer than anyone thought it would be. Cuccinelli lost, but I like to think our little app played a small part in picking up some votes we didn’t think we had. Technologically though, it was a big success.

I tell you that story because I’m getting questions about Cambridge Analytica and Facebook everywhere I turn. My answer has been, “it’s nothing we haven’t done.” The only difference is that we stopped accessing that data when Facebook plugged the data spigot. My app wouldn’t work today because Facebook changed the rules. We have a good relationship with Facebook and they know we’re a political agency and, as such, we’ll take every little bit of data they put in front of us.

Here’s a dirty little secret that you should know - all political operatives take data. Whether it’s old school excel spreadsheets or social data via APIs - if politicos can get their hands on data, they will take the data, keep the data, and probably even use the data on another campaign. Anyone who tells you different is absolutely lying and trying to ride some non-existent high horse. Politicos take data. Plain and simple. End of story. Pro-tip: if you’re running for office, make all politicos sign list confidentiality agreements.

So if Facebook turned off the spigot and I couldn’t build my app today, how did Cambridge Analytica pull it off?

It sounds like Facebook has different rules for political campaigns and academia. The man who accessed all the data, Aleksandr Kogan, was a researcher at Cambridge University. He told Facebook that he was accessing the data for academic purposes. He then built an app on top of the data for Cambridge Analytica.

So, who’s to blame here? Shit, man. I don’t know. Here’s what I do know:
<ol>
 	<li>Facebook used to allow us to access the same data using their Open Graph API but then changed the rules and cut off the spigot.</li>
 	<li>Facebook allows researchers to still access that data.</li>
 	<li>A researcher lied and said he was using the data for academic reasons, took the data, and then used it for political purposes.</li>
</ol>
One more thing I know: Facebook is giving us a service for free and we, in turn, are telling it and every other social media platform everything about ourselves. We’re bitching about privacy while standing in front of a window butt ass naked. Do we really think that people aren’t going to snap pictures and video when they see us standing there? That’s the world we live in now. We’re doing it to ourselves and then blaming corporate America.

The dude who lied is to blame. Cambridge Analytica is to blame. Yes, Facebook is to blame because they should have more oversight in this kind of situation, but they did change their rules and stop the flow of data for political reasons. Can they really stop people from lying?

You and I are also to blame. We’ve given up our privacy. When we give it up, people will take it.",,2018-03-28,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/the-truth-about-cambridge-analytica-and-privacy/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/180322_Push_Wesley_Cambridge_964x482-1.jpg,"Wesley Donehue Pondering The Truth About Cambridge Analytica And Privacy","Wesley Donehue Pondering The Truth About Cambridge Analytica And Privacy",,"Wesley Donehue Pondering The Truth About Cambridge Analytica And Privacy",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/180322_Push_Wesley_Cambridge_964x482-1.jpg,,Blog,analtyica|bullshit|cambridge|data|facebook|no|story,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,the-truth-about-cambridge-analytica-and-privacy,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-03-28
6451,"Advice To Mom and Pop Shops","Happy #nationalmomandpopshopday!

A lot has changed for the Mom and Pop shops of America. No longer is the next Mom and Pop shop down the street your big competition. You’re not just competing against the Targets and Walmarts down the street these days either. Today, you’re all competing against the one-click wonder that is Amazon.

No driving to the store and sitting in traffic. No searching through aisles of junk for what I really need. No longer finding what I need but it is the wrong size or color. No longer finding an empty spot where what I need is supposed to be. I can just open the app, find exactly what I need in 30 seconds, click one button and it arrive at my door in two days. Man, that experience just can’t be beat.

Yet, it can be beaten. I wrote about Toys R Us two weeks ago. You should click here and read that article.

I’m following up on that article because my brewery, Frothy Beard Brewing Company, just had two of it’s largest days in months. The first was on St Patrick’s Day when we threw a huge party. Drink specials, food specials and lots of St Patty’s Day themed activities. The following Saturday was our 5th Anniversary. All kinds of craziness ensued including an archery battle in the parking lot. No, we weren’t putting each other in the hospital. The arrows were foam tipped.

You can get beer anywhere. Hell, you can get great beer anywhere these days. But we don’t just give people great beer (and the best pizza in Charleston, SC). We give them something to do. We give them a place to hang out. We give them an experience.

Starbucks doesn’t just sell coffee. They are a place to work, to meet or to just chill for a little bit. Build-A-Bear doesn’t just sell teddy bears. They let you build your own custom teddy bear.

Hardware shops like Home Depot are now hosting DIY courses.

Do you sell t-shirts? Have t-shirt design contests and sell the winner in your store each week.

Do you sell books? We’d take our kids to book readings or costume contests where kids dress up as characters from the book of the week.

Do you sell tires? Teach classes that teach people how to change tires. Hell, I’ll go to that one.

Mom and Pop shops can’t just sell stuff. They have to find that Starbucks and Build-A-Bear equivalent. Every Mom and Pop shop has to do exactly what we’re doing at Frothy Beard Brewing. Give consumers an experience they can’t get anywhere else. That’s how you will survive, Mom and Pop.",,2018-03-29,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/advice-to-mom-and-pop-shops/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/180329_Push_MomPop_964x482.jpg,"Advice To Mom and Pop Shops","Advice To Mom and Pop Shops",,"Advice To Mom and Pop Shops",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/180329_Push_MomPop_964x482.jpg,,Blog,"advice|big advice|brick and mortar|digital marketing|marketing|mom and pop|shops|small business",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,advice-to-mom-and-pop-shops,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-03-29
6459,"The Merging of New And Old School Communications","We used to hear a lot about how digital was going to take over TV. I was one of the few digital guys who never made that claim. I always thought that TV content was here to stay, but that the method in which people consumed that content would change. In other words, digital and TV would blend together. That’s exactly what we’re seeing happen now.

I watch Star Trek Discovery with my CBS streaming app, The Walking Dead through iTunes, Game of Thrones on HBO’s app, Black Mirror via Netflix and Grey’s Anatomy (yes, I watch it and I’m not even embarrassed) on Hulu… I could go on and on.

As for devices, I typically watch them on my TV using AppleTV and Roku or on my iPad.

Digital isn’t eliminating TV. It’s changing TV.

The same can be said for traditional strategic communications and grassroots activity. Digital has changed the way we communicate for our clients and drum up grassroots support. That’s how we won uphill battles like creating a thriving craft beer industry and passed a roads funding bill in South Carolina. That’s how we’re getting difficult legislation passed in states across the country. However, the more digital work we do, the more we find that the old school, tried and true communications and grassroots strategies aren’t being replaced –they’re evolving to work in conjunction with new digital strategies. Just like CBS is working with online streaming platforms to broadcast the new Star Trek series.

Yes, going around journalists and straight to the voters with digital advertising is very effective, but journalists still matter –a lot. Every day we get calls asking if we can do our digital tactics AND talk directly to journalists because the operation is best when it’s working seamlessly and simultaneously. The same is true for grassroots work. Yes, drumming up emails and calls into legislative offices with digital tactics is the cheapest and most effective way to bombard a legislator, but direct contact from a Grasstops leader the Legislator personally knows is still extremely important. In fact, it can be argued that it’s even more important now because it cuts through the clutter of all the noise we’re creating with digital efforts.

That’s why we’ve expanded our Columbia, SC office and opened our new division, Push Strategic Communications. It’s just not smart in 2018 to run one without the other. Digital and offline efforts must be married. Direct outreach to voters, pitching journalists and offline contacts from trustworthy supporters must all work hand in hand. That’s what we’re doing with our new agency. We’re evolving because the public relations landscape is constantly evolving.

Push Strategic Communications is being led by Greg Foster. A longtime friend, Greg used to be a real thorn in my side. I ran communications for the South Carolina Senate Republican Caucus and he did the same for the House Republicans. Despite being the same party, the two chambers never got along. He was a worthy adversary and I quickly learned that he was one of the best communications guys I knew –and I was working with some of the most experienced folks across the nation.

Greg spent a decade at the SC State House honing his communications skills. He understands the art of messaging and the importance of leveraging relationships to produce outcomes –an offline ability that will greatly strengthen any online strategy.

Push Digital is a digital-first agency, but that doesn’t mean we can be a digital-only agency. Not in 2018. Those worlds aren’t dividing. They’re coming together to be one seamless effort.",,2018-04-02,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/the-merging-of-new-and-old-school-communications/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180402_Push_Greg_Wes_Blog.jpg,"The Merging of New And Old School Communications","The Merging of New And Old School Communications",,"The Merging of New And Old School Communications",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180402_Push_Greg_Wes_Blog.jpg,,Blog,"communications|digital|grass roots|marketing|new school|old school|push digital",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,the-merging-of-new-and-old-school-communications,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-04-02

6477,"Facebook Isn’t Selling Your Data","<div class=""gmail_quote"">
<div style=""text-align: left;"">What you’ve heard isn’t true. Facebook isn’t selling your data.</div>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let us repeat - Facebook is not selling your data.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With Mark Zuckerberg testifying in front of Congress last week, the internet is in a panic about how their data being used and whether it’s a </span><b>huge</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> breach of privacy. As an agency who uses Facebook to advertise on almost every media plan we build, we disagree that Facebook is the ‘big bad wolf’ everyone is making them out to be. And while we agree that they screwed up with Cambridge Analytica (<a href=""https://wesleydonehue.com/the-truth-about-cambridge-analytica-and-privacy/"">Click here to view article</a>), here is why you shouldn’t be freaked out:</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Facebook doesn’t give advertisers your actual identification. They only let us advertise to a pool of users after we give them specific parameters. We have no idea who the specific people in that pool are.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For instance: we are able to target males in their 30's, married with two kids, driving a Jeep, living in Summerville, S.C. who have an interest in Star Trek and running marathons. We are NOT able to target Wesley Donehue. Facebook’s platform anonymizes its local data. As an advertiser, we have no idea of the identification of the actual people we are targeting. We repeat,</span><b> advertisers on Facebook never get identification information unless you share it.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let’s say we’re advertising for Altra shoes... Of course, we want to target Males who have an interest in Marathons... it’s the product our client sells. But unless Wesley Donehue actually purchases a pair of shoes on the Altra website, we don’t know that Wesley Donehue is the individual engaging with our ads.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The granularity of data Facebook has on its users is no different than the data that Google, Amazon or Yahoo all have on their users. Facebook just has more of it because that’s where you’re spending all your time and where you’re sharing everything about yourself.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is also no different than the way advertisers have been purchasing TV, radio and newspaper ads for decades. The station or publisher gives advertisers the demographics of their viewers/readers and </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">then the advertiser builds creative around that specific audience. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Again, the only difference is the amount of data those stations and publishers have on their users. Believe us, if they had what Facebook has, </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">they would use it in a heartbeat</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The definition of “selling” is “giving or handing over something in exchange for money.”  Facebook provides access to a pool of users, but it does not hand over that information to us. We cannot remove the information from Facebook and keep it for ourselves. We can only put our creative material into the Facebook platform and have them show that creative to their users for us. We have no ownership of anything. We don’t buy anything. Facebook doesn’t sell anything.</span></p>

</div>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Moral of the story: Facebook isn’t as scary you think it is... And if you’re still worried, you should probably quit using the internet all together!</span></p>

6511,"Trump’s Tariffs Will Hurt Craft Beer","Love him or hate him, one thing is for certain - President Donald Trump is hurting the craft beer industry.

President Trump’s trade war with China should come as no surprise. He repeatedly promised on the campaign trail that he would fight the Asian country’s unfair trade practices. On March 1, 2018, he stood by that promise, imposing hard tariffs on steel and aluminum.

“People have no idea how badly our country has been treated by other countries,” President Trump claimed. “They’ve destroyed the steel industry, they’ve destroyed the aluminum industry, and other industries, frankly.”

Of course, he followed that statement up with a tweet:

“When a country [USA] is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy!”

Sure, the tariffs may help our nation’s steel and aluminum industries, but in doing so, it crushes the exploding beer industry that relies on steel tanks and aluminum cans.

According to Jim McGreevy, President of the Beer Institute, ""the aluminum tariff alone could cost the industry $347.7 million and result in the loss of more than 20,000 jobs nationwide.""

Frothy Beard Brewing partner, Joey Siconolfi, addressed the issue on <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/2018/04/16/trumps-steel-tariffs-could-impact-price-can-beer.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Fox News</a>:
<blockquote>In South Carolina’s coastal city of Charleston, a group of friends started Frothy Beard Brewing Company in 2013, which has grown 400 percent since it opened. The owners say the tariffs on steel or aluminum could impact their future business growth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We’ve been buying new steel tanks, (and) we are planning to add two or three more,” Frothy Beard Brewing Co. head brewer Joey Siconolfi told Fox News. “So, it’s a 25 percent increase on steel they’re talking about and we are also getting into canning…that can have a huge impact….”</blockquote>
<blockquote> Frothy Beard Brewing cans more than 18,000 beers in one day. They have plans to expand their canning production, but they say it could cost them hundreds of dollars per day. Siconolfi said the aluminum cans typically cost 12 cents each. If the 10 percent tariff on aluminum is applied, the cost for 18,000 cans would go up from about $2,100 to more than $2,300.</blockquote>
OUCH! ?

Frothy Beard’s other partner, Steve McCauley, also addressed the issue, talking to Charleston’s <a href=""https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/trump-s-tariffs-brewing-trouble-for-south-carolina-s-growing/article_65dc2d12-305f-11e8-9e9b-77a486c243e9.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Post and Courier</a>:
<blockquote>When Frothy Beard Brewing Co. started canning its signature jalapeno cilantro pale ale in October, the bright green aluminum cans carried hope for the Charleston brewery trying to expand into other markets.</blockquote>
<blockquote>But now, something new is clouding Frothy Beard's 10-barrel system off Ashley River Road: Fear.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Since last month when President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum, South Carolina brewers have been scrambling to determine how the trade war will trickle into taprooms.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Frothy Beard co-owner Steve McCauley, who oversees packaging and distribution, said rumors in the industry are swirling. He's heard aluminum prices could increase anywhere from 1 penny to 5 cents per can from the tariffs that took effect March 23.</blockquote>
<blockquote>""There's going to be reckoning, but none of us knows what it's going to be yet,"" McCauley said. ""The sad thing is that whatever it is, it's probably all going to get passed to the consumer.""</blockquote>
???

At Frothy Beard Brewing Co., we’re going to keep growing. We’re going to buy more steel tanks and distribute more beer in aluminum cans. We’re not going to stop. That is... until you get sick of the rising cost of craft beer. When that happens, you can thank President Donald Trump.

6532,"I Drink Unicorn Piss To Dominate Life","I’ve come to a sad conclusion about our culture — No one cares about the human traits we used to find best in a man. You know, those things Jesus Christ himself told us to portray; humility, honesty and kindness. Today, we idolize those who make bold claims about themselves and their abilities, even when their claims are rambling rants in the form of tweets, barely distinguishable from a two-year-old just learning the English language.

We buy their records. We obsess over their reality shows. We even elect them to public office.  We love it. We digest every second, every ounce of it. The media shoves it down our throats for ratings and clicks. Talking heads flood the airwaves, giving their opinions on the latest gossip.

What has become crystal clear is that the idea of problems and solutions has been completely wiped off the American mindset. Research, logic, big ideas, concern... all dead. No one. Gives. A Shit. Now it’s, <em>let’s all follow the absolutely loudest and most colorful person.</em> The person we turn to for answers is the self-indulging, selfish person who feeds off your attention. The person who will say and do absolutely anything to make you love them. Or hate them. Hell, it really doesn’t matter, as long as it’s about them.

I’m a businessman. When people want cheeseburgers, I make cheeseburgers. That’s why I’ve decided to go all in.  I’m 100% dedicated to the insanity. That’s the path to power, to money, to love. So, I’m changing my tone right now.

I mean, why not?  I’m the smartest person I know. It’s time for everyone else to know that too. Clearly everything I touch turns to gold. I am the path to power and prosperity for my clients. I don’t lose when a client does exactly what I say. I am the way.

I’m the best political operative in America. I touch the hearts of every voter, every demo, every district. My creative is the political equivalent to Van Gogh, but even more bloody because I don’t just cut off ears. I slay every opponent who comes my way like David slayed Goliath, but I didn’t even have to sling a rock. I do it through pure will and power of mind.

Ask all the people around me. Ask my team. There is no team better on the North American continent. And I’m not just talking about in politics or marketing, I mean in any industry.

I build monuments to causes that will never be torn down. I’ve been in my cave and now I return with the speed of a cheetah and the motivation of a bull, running down the crowded streets of my blood vessels.

A complete witch hunt!

The witches come but they can’t find me. I hide in the dark corner of their minds, taunting their spiritual needs. Their spells deflected by the love of all my fans. I pull on the strings and my fans twirl. All for me. In whichever direction I demand.

I win. Everything.

It comes from the unicorn piss I drink with my vitamins made of hippopotamus sweat.

It’s what you eat. It’s what you want. I will solve all your problems. Believe it. Because I said it. Because I’m the best at everything. #tigerblood #dragonenergy

6537,"Harlowe’s Hats and May The 4th Be With You","Okay, a quick story about child birth. You’ve been warned. ?

Elizabeth went into labor with our first son, Harlowe, on the evening of May 4th. While she was in labor, I asked her if she could hold on for a couple more hours so that Harlowe would be born on May 5th. “Every birthday party can be Cinco De Mayo themed,” I explained, promptly receiving an eye-roll as a response.

That’s when it hit me — May 4th is Star Wars Day! Hell yes! My son is going to be born on Star Wars Day. <em>May the 4th be forever with us</em>. Elizabeth was not amused…

Fast forward a few months, before he could even walk. Harlowe would grab anything that would stay on his head and call it a “hat.”

You can view a bunch of them on <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/wesleydonehue"">Instagram</a> with #HarlowesHats.

Every year on Harlowe’s birthday, we release a special beer in his honor. Harlowe’s Hats is a peanut butter and banana porter because, well, his favorite snack was always peanut butter and banana.

Even though Harlowe has seventeen years until he can try his special brew, you can have as much as you want, hang out with our family, AND celebrate Star Wars Day all at once!

The festivities pop off at 5:00 pm on Friday. We will be there until at least 7:00 pm. Me, Harlowe, Tennyson, the Frothy team and some of the Push team will be dressed up. If I’m lucky I’ll even get Elizabeth to dress up.
<h5>If I’m real lucky, I’ll get Elizabeth to dress up as slave Leia. ?</h5>

We’ve decided to use Insta Stories to show you exactly what it’s like working for Push Digital from the perspective of each and everyone of our teammates. We’re turning over the account to a different Pusher every week day.

Want to know what it’s like being an account executive, an advertising expert, a designer, a videographer?

6566,"Pushing Positive Vibes On Everyone We Meet","We’re knife fighters. It comes from our political background. We work hard. We work fast. We get shit done. Here’s a video all about our culture. I hope you’ll watch it.

But here’s the thing - that political background gives us the ability to operate at a different level than most agencies, but it can also hurt us. Politics is extremely negative. There’s a lot of drama. Everyone is trying to cut everyone else’s throats. It’s Game of Thrones on crack. Look, the corporate world is like that too, but politics is politics.

Negativity can harm morale. It can be downright depressing. And that’s the big problem - low morale and depression dramatically decreases creativity (unless your Van Gogh or Ernest Hemingway, but we don’t want our staff offing themselves).

That’s why you’re hearing so much about POSITIVE VIBES. In our line of work, we can’t just talk about it. We have to live it. Everything we do at Push Digital is about positivity. We force fun into our meetings, our calls, on our staff and even on our clients. Hell, our agency is literally inside of a brewery for this exact reason.

We believe that when we’re having fun and smiling, our brains are stimulated and they’re working harder and more creatively. We see it in our strategies. We see it in our designs. We see it in our videos. We see it in our results.

<strong>POSITIVE VIBES = POSITIVE RESULTS</strong>

Check out this new video and hear from our staff on why we push POSITIVE VIBES.

<p style=""padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;""><span style=""color: #808080;"">“What are my fitness goals? I want to feel better about myself, to start taking better care of my body, and if I lost a little weight in that process I wouldn’t be mad. (But I mean who would?) So to make those things happen, I need y’all’s help! How do you stay motivated? How do you stay on a consistent schedule? How much do your eating habits affect the way you work out?
I’m open to any and all suggestions! Help ya girl get fit and then stay tuned to figure out how exactly I plan on doing it.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">That’s how one of our Account Executives recently closed a post on her personal blog <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://lovelyingrey.com/2018/04/12/fitness/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-href=""https://lovelyingrey.com/2018/04/12/fitness/""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">here</strong></a>. As CEO and an avid fitness junkie, I get questions about staying motivated (whether it’s fitness or work) all the time.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">So today I’m giving advice to all those who find themselves trying to change their situation. This is for all those who want to start but don’t know how to actually get started. For all those sitting in front of a computer all day, snacking on bullshit with no actual plan.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p""><em class=""markup--em markup--p-em"">*Disclaimer: I’m not an athlete, coach, nutritionist or a doctor. I’m just a guy who’s proven that the following advice works, and is sharing the knowledge.</em></p>
<p class=""graf graf--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">1. Start Small</strong></p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">Through a lot of trial and error I’ve learned that when trying to get better — in fitness or at work — it’s always best to start with the basics. Start small and build up. For example, we all know fad diets don’t work. You do it for awhile, lose some pounds, get sick of the regime and then those pounds suddenly reappear. It’s the same with work. You can’t build Rome in a day. Don’t try to go all in at once. Just like you would cut the bad things out of your diet one by one, try to cut out one bad work habit per week.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">Week 1: Stop saying “I’ll get to it.” Make realistic to-do lists for immediate, ongoing and future tasks.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">Week 2: Stop letting your inbox pile up. Take the time to tackle it and answer every email you can.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">Week 3: Stop putting things off. Just because you may not want to do something doesn’t mean it will go away. Just get it done. Eliminate procrastination.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">Week 4: Stop waiting for direction. Speak up. Take more initiative.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">2. Reset</strong></p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">This may be more commonly known as having a “cheat day.” It’s okay to splurge once in a while when you’re on a diet. Just like it’s okay to give yourself time to reset at work. As CEO, I give my employees the option to work remotely on Wednesdays. I think the time that they have at home helps their energy stay up when they’re in the office, it helps keep their creativity fresh by providing a change in scenery, and it gives them a chance to reset.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">3. Set Goals</strong></p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">I’m a firm believer in goals. If you don’t know where you want to end up, how are you ever going to get there? Pick the destination, set the course, and go! A goal gives you something to celebrate. It gives you a light at the end of the table. Most importantly, it gives you a reason to get out of bed in the morning. So whether it’s the 5k you signed up for or the big presentation you want to kick ass on, that big day is coming no matter what. You can stay in bed but you’re going to fail. Get out of bed and work every day until you reach your goal.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">4. Find A Battle Buddy</strong></p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">Why are running clubs so popular? Why do you think successful people always find themselves in the company of other successful people? It’s because who you surround yourself with often reflects who you are. In fitness and in work, make sure you surround yourself with people that provide positive vibes, help you stay sharp and push you to be your best. The team you join (or build) is a great indicator of just how well you will perform. Why do you think I’ve hired so many bad asses at Push Digital?!</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">5. Flexibility Matters</strong></p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">Stay flexible. While it may seem obvious that flexibility is important in fitness, it’s equally as important within a business. As a digital marketing firm, everyone at Push Digital has to be able to change directions at the drop of a hat. Whether that means in the creative process, dealing with constant changes to digital advertising platforms or sometimes working after hours to meet the needs of your client — flexibility and adaptability are key.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">My advice may not turn you into a beast in the gym or in the office, but it will get you started. It will help you get healthier, advance at work and maybe even make more money.</p>
<p class=""graf graf--p"">It’s important to point out one very important fact: the brain and the body are connected, just in case you didn’t realize that yet. The mind is sluggish when the body is sluggish. The mind is unhealthy when the body is unhealthy. Remember to start small, take time to reset, set goals, find your battle team and stay flexible. You’ll be more clear minded, you’ll be more productive, you’ll be more creative. In short, you’ll be a better worker.</p>",,2018-05-10,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/advice-for-office-staff/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/medium.jpg,medium,,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/medium.jpg,,Blog,,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,advice-for-office-staff,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-05-10

I want to give you the more honest description.I’m not easy to work for. I’m not an asshole or the kind of boss that yells at people. I just move super quick and I’m constantly bouncing from one thing to another. It’s hard to keep up with me. You’ll receive messages at 4 AM because that’s when I wake up and my mind is thinking of work the most. You’ll get messages on the weekends and when I’m jotting ideas down on a napkin at happy hour. It would be your job to keep all that organized, to keep my life in order.

I’m the CEO of five digital agencies under one brand. I’m a partner in a brewery and a pizzeria. I’m currently building a new holding company with new business ventures. I’m married with two boys. I’m training for an Ironman. My schedule is literally booked from the moment I wake up until the moment I go to sleep. I’m always traveling. My schedule is EVERYTHING and you would be its keeper.

On top of keeping my life in order, you will also be responsible for the marketing of Push Digital, Frothy Beard Brewing, Zombie Bob’s Pizza and my personal brand. That’s because I refuse to give those up to anyone else and I oversee them myself. So basically, you would be one-part personal assistant and one-part account executive.

You’ll get more entrepreneurial experience than anyone else in the company because you’ll be my right hand. You’ll see the big picture ideas as well as all the nitty gritty details.

This is probably the toughest job in the entire company. It’s stressful. It’s hard work. It’s also super fun and rewarding. You’ll learn more about business in six months than you would in four years of college. Also, as tough as I am to work for, I’m also super fun and I take care of my team.

Yesterday our advertising team, led by Brooke Willaby, was in Washington, DC to meet with Facebook and Google representatives to discuss how the changes will impact our work and our clients. We’ve been getting a lot of questions from our clients and friends about these changes. Instead of typing up a whole blog post to answer these questions I’ve decided to publish an internal Push Digital memo Brooke distributed last week to our team.</p>
<p id=""f46b"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">I hope this helps answer some of your questions. Brooke asked that I let you know that these new changes are happening rapidly and last week alone we received four separate emails from Facebook about their changes.

<strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong""><span style=""color: #333333;"">BACKGROUND</span>
</strong>As a result of the Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Cambridge Analytica data breach, Facebook has been actively updating its political advertising policies to create transparency and prevent future abuse in elections. See the original announcement<a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/10/improving-enforcement-and-transparency/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/10/improving-enforcement-and-transparency/""> <strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">here</strong>.</a></p>
<p class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong""><span style=""color: #333333;"">3 MAJOR CHANGES:</span>
</strong>1. Ads must be placed by an authorized user
2. All “political” ads must carry a paid for disclaimer
3. All “political” ads will be added into a public political archive</p>
<p id=""c33c"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong""><span style=""color: #333333;"">WHAT IS BEING DEFINED AS A POLITICAL AD?</span>
</strong>Electoral ads aren’t the only ads being categorized as political. As of May 8th, “issue ads” concerning political topics being debated around the country are also considered political ads. Facebook developed an initial list of key issues, but it is important to note that this list will continue to evolve over time. See the full current list <a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/business/help/214754279118974"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-href=""https://www.facebook.com/business/help/214754279118974""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">here</strong></a>.</p>
<p id=""aa48"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">One of Push Digital’s Facebook representatives went even further to clarify by saying, “If the ad is advocating for or against a position on one of the issues outlined in the list we released yesterday, or broadly encouraging Congress or another legislative body to take some form of action, I’d anticipate that those ads will also need to follow the political guidelines.”</p>
<p id=""fd77"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong""><span style=""color: #333333;"">AUTHORIZED USERS</span>
</strong>Advertisers must be authorized as a political advertiser. This involves verifying each advertisers identity and location (through the US Mail). Additionally, all ad accounts must be identified as political and disclose who is paying for the ads.</p>
<p id=""ce14"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong""><span style=""color: #333333;"">DISCLAIMER</span>
</strong>Every ad will show a “paid for by” disclaimer. The paid for disclaimer can be up to 360 characters and must be accurate and complete. The disclaimer will go through a 24 hour approval process once submitted. Disclaimers can be edited at any time, but will go through Facebook’s approval process again. Facebook has not yet released what exactly this will look like on the ad, but we will keep you updated as we get more information.</p>
<p id=""db4a"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><em class=""markup--em markup--p-em"">Note: Facebook’s disclaimer field is not a substitute for the obligation to include in your ad all necessary disclaimers and other notices required by law.</em></p>
<p id=""7d37"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong""><span style=""color: #333333;"">ARCHIVE</span>
</strong>Facebook is releasing a public, searchable political ads “archive” that will contain all ads with the “Political Ad” label. It will update in near-real time basis (within an hour) and ads will remain in the archive for 7 years. The archive will show the image and text, as well as additional information like the ad spend, impressions shown, unique reach and demographic audience information for each ad. Ad spend, Impressions, and Reach will be shown in ranges instead of exact amounts. Below are the initial ranges for the launch on May 22nd. These ranges will change over time.

6613,"Fitness Advice For Office Staff — Part 2","<p id=""3d1a"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--h3"">(Note: Last week I wrote this <span style=""color: #0000ff;""><a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" style=""color: #0000ff;"" href=""https://wesleydonehue.com/advice-for-office-staff/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-href=""https://wesleydonehue.com/advice-for-office-staff/""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">post</strong></a>.</span> The original concept of the post was to give pure fitness advice to my staff who kept asking, but that piece got turned into something much different for our company blog. I still thought this post, as originally, drafted was important for my team so I’m also sharing it here with you on my personal blog. I hope it can help get some of you started. — Wesley)</p>

<blockquote id=""a085"" class=""graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"">“What are my fitness goals? I want to feel better about myself, to start taking better care of my body, and if I lost a little weight in that process I wouldn’t be mad. (But I mean who would?) So to make those things happen, I need y’all’s help! How do you stay motivated? How do you stay on a consistent schedule? How much do your eating habits affect the way you work out?</blockquote>
<blockquote id=""2159"" class=""graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"">I’m open to any and all suggestions! Help ya girl get fit and then stay tuned to figure out how exactly I plan on doing it.”</blockquote>
<p id=""4fe8"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"">That’s how one of our Account Executives recently closed a post on her personal <span style=""color: #0000ff;""><a class=""markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"" style=""color: #0000ff;"" href=""https://lovelyingrey.com/2018/04/12/fitness/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" data-href=""https://lovelyingrey.com/2018/04/12/fitness/""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">blog</strong></a></span>. I’m always being asked what I do to stay motivated — just recently three other staffers asked me those same questions. So today I’m going to give advice to all those workers, including my team, who find themselves sitting in front of a computer all day, snacking on bullshit, with no actual plan to get fit. This is for everyone who wants to start, but don’t know how to actually get started.</p>
<p id=""1899"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><em class=""markup--em markup--p-em"">*Disclaimer: I’m not an athlete, coach, nutritionist or a doctor. I’m just a guy who’s proven that the following advice works, and is sharing the knowledge.</em></p>
<p id=""9c12"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Through a lot of trial and error I’ve learned that there are a few key things to keep in mind when getting started with fitness:</p>
<p id=""124d"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">1. Cut The Crap</strong></p>
<p id=""5ca0"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">We all know that fad diets don’t work. You’ll do it for awhile, lose some pounds, get sick of the regime and then those pounds will suddenly reappear. Skip the diets and just eat healthy. Starting the process is as easy as cutting out one unhealthy thing a week. Don’t try to go all in at once. Start small. This is how it went for me:</p>
<p id=""8752"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Week 1: Cut fast food</p>
<p id=""a499"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Week 2: Cut soda</p>
<p id=""3d15"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Week 3: Cut sugar out of my coffee</p>
<p id=""189b"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Week 4: Cut dairy out of my coffee</p>
<p id=""3db6"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Week 5: Cut all processed foods</p>
<p id=""3e52"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Week 6: Cut all dairy</p>
<p id=""d3db"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Personally, I don’t have a big sweet tooth so candy and other sweets weren’t on my “cut out now” list. Once I had eliminated what I wanted to out of my diet, I started concentrating on what I SHOULD eat: organic foods, lots of fruits and veggies and clean meats.</p>
<p id=""d515"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">2. Cheat Days</strong></p>
<p id=""416f"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">It’s okay to splurge. Food is one of life’s greatest pleasures. I personally use Saturdays as my day to take in as much crap food as I can. Six days on and one day off is the most effective way for me to stay healthy while keeping my sanity. It may be different for you, so be sure to strike up a good balance between on and off days to find what’s right for you. Ease into it and give your body time to adjust. You’ll find your balance eventually.</p>
<p id=""2850"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">3. No Excuses</strong></p>
<p id=""2a51"" class=""graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"">“I can’t run” is the biggest bullshit excuse I’ve ever heard. Everyone can run. Not everyone can go out and run five miles on their first try, but everyone can run. Again, this is all about starting small. Don’t get discouraged because you can’t run a quarter of a mile. Forget the distances for now. Just run as long as you can, and then walk. Then do it again and again until you find a ratio that works for you. A few options include: run 2 minutes, walk 1 minute; run 3 minutes, walk 1 minute; run 4 minutes, walk 1 minute.</p>
<p id=""4c5c"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Once you get your rhythm down, put your focus back on distances. Aim for one mile on the first day, a mile and a quarter on the second, a mile and a half on the third, and so on and so forth. It’s all about start small and growing. Before you know it, you’ll be at ten miles with no clue how you got there. There’s no excuse for not trying. You can run — so lace up and get going.</p>
<p id=""a1cd"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">4. Set A Goal</strong></p>
<p id=""bee1"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">I’m a firm believer in goals. If you don’t know where you want to end up, how are you ever going to get there? Pick the destination, set the course and go! An event gives you something to celebrate. It gives you a light at the end of the tunnel. But most importantly, it gives you a reason to get out of bed in the morning. The big day is coming no matter what. So work hard every single day until that big day — whether it’s a 5k, a 10k, a half marathon or a triathlon — arrives.</p>
<p id=""4095"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">5. Find A Battle Buddy</strong></p>
<p id=""4f23"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">This is ultimately what changed my life. I have my workout group, F3. I can’t tell you how important they are to me. My guys text me at night asking me if I’m going to workout the next day and then they beat my ass when I don’t show up. Even if I don’t want to go, I know that my guys are waiting on me. I can’t let my F3 brothers down. And in return, they don’t let me down. They keep us accountable. So find yourself an accountability partner (aka a battle buddy), and start kicking some serious ass!</p>
<p id=""6ffb"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p""><strong class=""markup--strong markup--p-strong"">6. Stay Flexible</strong></p>
<p id=""f2c0"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">Mobility matters. It just does. I may be fast, but I’m as stiff as the Tin Man. Most of my current fitness problems come from hunching over a computer for decades. Y’all, trust me on this. Sitting all day does a lot of damage. Please get up. Walk around during your conference calls. Use a standup desk. Sign up for a couple of yoga classes a week. Staying active in the small ways is the easiest way to start getting in shape.</p>
<p id=""c2b1"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p"">My advice may not turn you into a beast immediately, but it will definitely get you started. These six simple tips will help you get healthier, and help counteract the effects of sitting in front of a computer for hours upon hours every day.</p>
<p id=""9275"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"">It’s important to point out one very important fact: the brain and the body are connected, just in case you didn’t realize that yet. The mind is sluggish when the body is sluggish. The mind is unhealthy when the body is unhealthy. Remember to start small, cut the crap, find your rhythm, set goals, find your battle team and stay flexible. You’ll be more clear minded, you’ll be more productive, you’ll be more creative. In short, you’ll be a better worker.</p>",,2018-05-17,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/fitness-advice-for-office-staff-part-2/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Blog-image-insta-2.jpg,"Blog image insta 2",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Blog-image-insta-2.jpg,,Blog,,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,fitness-advice-for-office-staff-part-2,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-05-17
6631,"The Latino Voter Base is Booming: Why You Should Care","<h3><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Holding A Goldfish’s Attention </strong></span></h3>
<span style=""color: #808080;"">Digital technology has changed politics. You can no longer look at one without the other, and while that may be for better or for worse, candidates across the nation are seeking digital experts for the competitive edge needed amidst close elections.  </span>
<span style=""color: #808080;"">For our political team, that means studying news media trends, navigating digital platforms, and analyzing demographic data to push content that mobilizes voters with the right message at the right time. And while digital technology has allowed political campaigns to access a plethora of voter data, campaign success relies on figuring out how best to cut through the information overload, access echo chambers, and grab voters’ attention. With our attention span becoming <a style=""color: #808080;"" href=""http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/"">shorter</a> than that of a goldfish’s, seeking and capturing the American voters’ attention long enough to care about an issue is no easy feat. Fortunately for our candidates, Push Digital always stays one step ahead.</span>
<h3><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Tapping Into the Latino Vote
</span></strong><span style=""color: #808080;"">Fun fact: Every 30 seconds, a Latino becomes eligible to <a style=""color: #808080;"" href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/08/every-30-seconds-a-latino-reaches-voting-age-you-read-that-right/432627/]"">vote</a></span></h3>
<span style=""color: #808080;"">Resourcefulness and adaptation. To survive the ever-changing political landscape in today’s digital era, you need both of these skills. As a Colombian-born millennial working for Push Digital’s political team, I am a direct manifestation of one of the many evolutions seen throughout recent American elections – a rising Latino voter population.</span>
<span style=""color: #808080;"">As of 2016, more than 27.3 million Latino voters were <a style=""color: #808080;"" href=""http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/01/19/millennials-make-up-almost-half-of-latino-eligible-voters-in-2016/"">eligible to vote</a>, and that number has been continually growing since.  In fact, <a style=""color: #808080;"" href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/16/with-fewer-new-arrivals-census-lowers-hispanic-population-projections-2/"">estimates</a> show that by 2050, the Latino population will rise to 133 million.</span>
<span style=""color: #808080;"">But here’s the thing, the rate of eligible Latino voters is increasing <em>faster </em>than the number of Latino voters from our previous <a style=""color: #808080;"" href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/14/key-facts-about-the-latino-vote-in-2016/"">presidential elections</a>. In other words, while the Latino voter base is growing, actual turnout pales in comparison.</span>
<h3><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Bridging the Gap Between Voter and Ballot </strong></span></h3>
<span style=""color: #808080;"">While knowledge of the rising Latino voter population in the U.S. is nothing new, it’s more pertinent to campaign success than ever before. Now the largest ethnic minority in the country, this group’s influence over the political agenda is far-reaching. Safe to say, appealing to this demographic is the golden ticket to winning elections, and to do that, we must do the following:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style=""color: #333333;""><strong>Dispel Myths</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><span style=""color: #808080;"">Even though Latinos have historically leaned left of the ideological spectrum, we saw a surprising, and quite unexpected change within the GOP voter base, as Latinos made up roughly 29% of the Trump voter electoral base in <a style=""color: #808080;"" href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/opinion/election-night-2016/heres-what-happened-with-the-latino-vote"">2016</a>. Continuing polarization among parties will allow further capitalization of this change, and Republican political campaigns especially will need to adapt digital strategies to reach a more ethnically diverse voter base.</span></p>

<ol start=""2"">
 	<li><span style=""color: #333333;""><strong>  Methodology</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><span style=""color: #808080;"">The largest percentage of eligible Latino voters are millennials. Which is great, because they have a <a style=""color: #808080;"" href=""https://www.nationaljournal.com/next-america/economic-empowerment/billenials-are-cultural-chameleons-20150731"">higher tendency</a> to be digitally inclined, bilingual, and aspirational. So how can campaigns target this group to increase voter turnout, especially within battleground states like Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio? According to <a style=""color: #808080;"" href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/08/every-30-seconds-a-latino-reaches-voting-age-you-read-that-right/432627/"">surveys,</a> young voters within this demographic are ambivalent over casting a vote, simply because they feel it won’t make a difference… Oh the irony. To mobilize young Latino voters, the effort must be put in regardless of the risk. At Push Digital, clients are coming to us to reach this demographic because they know it’s in their campaign’s best interest.</span></p>

<ol start=""3"">
 	<li><span style=""color: #333333;""><strong>  Curated Content</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><span style=""color: #808080;"">There are many challenges that come with connecting to an ethnically diverse voter population. For one, candidates may face backlash from voters who only speak the English language. <a style=""color: #808080;"" href=""https://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/ads-public-opinion/spanish-language-political-ads-research"">Studies</a> show English-speaking voters’ attitudes over seeing Spanish-language political ads to be extremely negative.  Likewise, not every Latino population is the same and should be advertised the same content, even within the message matrix. This is particularly true when it comes to different dialects of Spanish speakers. In order to effectively communicate political messages among Latino voters - content needs to be curated in accordance with language, dialect, age, and country of origin. It’s important to keep these items in mind when developing your message and digital targeting.  </span></p>
<span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>Have I lost you yet? </strong></span>

<span style=""color: #808080;"">There’s a reason a large source of the Latino Voter population remains untapped - it’s gruesome work. Mitigating between the digital space, political arena, and rising diversity among the U.S. voter population is tricky terrain. But someone’s gotta do it, and here at Push Digital, we aren’t afraid of a little challenge. ?</span>

<span style=""color: #808080;"">Thanks for reading,</span>

6663,"SeaWorld: Rebuilding A Brand","Push digital has come a long way over the years. What started off as a small digital political marketing firm with a few people wearing many hats, is now a rock-solid digital company made up of over 40 creative specialists, political gurus, and content creators that are battle-tested and ready for any brand or crisis management that comes our way (sometimes both).

This week, we took a hard look at the results we accomplished for SeaWorld.

The SeaWorld brand was deeply severed following the release of the documentary, Blackfish. And It wasn't long before we had to step in to put out the fire. By creating a marketing campaign that took you behind-the-scenes and showcased the company's work to improve our planet, SeaWorld's brand favorability increased 7% in Q1 of 2018.

SeaWorld needed us. And we delivered. The spot we created ""From Park to Planet"" was rated the best travel ad on record—It improved SeaWorld's brand, drove attendance, and cleaned up their tarnished reputation.

The long and the short of it is, Hotspot and I got our asses kicked for nearly 40 hours on the beaches of Normandy by American special forces operators on the anniversary of D-Day. Over 600 men have come through F3 Summerville and Hotspot and I were the first ones to earn the coveted lightning bolt patch. Up until yesterday, we remained the only two.

This weekend, two years to the date of our Normandy adventure, GORUCK held a D-Day themed HTL right here in Charleston, SC. Because of my Ironman training I decided to forego the hardest parts of the event, but I did jump in for the last five hours, the Light, to support my F3 Summerville brothers who were going for the bolts. I choked back tears watching my brothers Double Trouble, Defib, KY and Stringbean get patched, thinking about how much that little piece of fabric has meant to me.

A lot of bloggers write about how awesome their lives are. They’re crushing it. Everything they touch is gold. You should buy their book or pay for their video subscription and learn how to be just like them. In a matter of 6 months you will be making an extra million a month and driving that Ferrari. About 95% of it is Internet garbage. It’s <a class=""_58cn"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/fakenews?source=feed_text"" data-ft=""{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;*N&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:104}""><span class=""_5afx""><span class=""_58cl _5afz"" aria-label=""hashtag"">#</span><span class=""_58cm"">FakeNews</span></span></a>.

Let me be a lot more real with you -- 2018 has SUCKED. We entered the year with the best client roster, best staff and the most momentum we’ve ever had. Then within 30 days we lost three major corporate clients because of internal turnover and I decided to part ways with a premiere statewide candidate.

For the first time in the agency’s history, I had more money going out than coming in. I laid off staff for the first time. I stopped sleeping. I stopped eating. I stressed puked every morning. I kept getting sick over and over again. I hid from my friends and F3 brothers.

I’ve been through more stress throughout my life than most humans I know. Dealing with stress is my superpower. I’ve always been able to just muscle through it. But this time was different. The more I pushed, the more I got stressed, the more I got sick, the more I was out of commission.

I made a decision. I moved all my race medals and GORUCK patches to my office. I started staring at them. They are right behind this computer as I type this sentence. I look one inch to the right and there they are. A real reminder of some shit I’ve endured.

<img class=""wp-image-6682 aligncenter"" src=""https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Image-uploaded-from-iOS-4-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" width=""473"" height=""355"" />

One random day a thought popped into my head- I didn’t just endure those events. I didn’t just push through them. I developed a plan. I put all the pieces in place to enact the plan. In every single event I’ve taken on, I’ve crossed the finish line. No matter how slow or how painful, I ALWAYS finished. And more importantly - I learned something new from each event. I learned something about myself. I learned how to find comfort in pain.

I put together a new business vision and a new plan of action. I brought on new people and restructured the team. I reassigned job duties, including mine. I can give you pages upon pages of details, but you don’t want all that right now. The summary is simple: I decided to get comfortable being uncomfortable. I found comfort in this new uneasy place in which I found myself and my company. I found comfort in the instability. That reduced the stress, enabling me to take a step back to develop a plan of action.

It’s exactly what I did two years ago when hiking in the middle of the night alongside Omaha Beach from Point Du Hoc. My feet completely covered in blisters, my back and shoulders on fire, and my head in the darkest place it’s ever been in, I decided right then and there to enjoy the pain because the pain was proof of progress. I found comfort in complete anguish. That enabled me to get my mind right. That enabled me to develop a plan. And that enabled me to finish.

When my boys got their patch this weekend, I could see on their faces that they’ve been exactly where I’ve been. Not just two years ago- but two months ago. The same dark place. The same path out. It’s the same damn thing.

Today, we’re almost back to the place we originally planned for 2018. We’ve picked up some huge clients, including a Fortune 70 company. We’re in the process of hiring more people than we laid off, bringing us to the largest and most talented staff we’ve had yet. And we’re less than one week from moving into our expanded office.

I get asked all the time “How do you have time to run your business when you’re training all the time?” Where I then ask myself, “How else could I learn such valuable business lessons?”

6685,"The Most Little Bitch Thing I’ve Ever Thought","Two years ago I walked along the cliffs between Pointe Du Hoc and Omaha Beach. We were about 35 hours into a long endurance event put on by GORUCK known as the HTL. The Heavy, Tough and Light are three back-to-back-to-back events. The Heavy is 24 hours. The Tough is 12 hours. The Light is 5 hours.

My feet were covered in blisters and rubbed raw from the Heavy’s 40 mile walk, carrying a 40 pound ruck, which was preceeded by re-enactments of us storming and low crawling across Utah Beach. We were covered in sand from head to toe without the ability to wash ourselves off before the long walk. With every step the sand rubbed across my skin like sandpaper. My feet, the space between my legs (including those sensitive spots), under my arms... everything was raw. Still we marched on carrying as much heavy shit as the cadre could pile on our shoulders.

I completed the Heavy but the damage was done by the time we started the Tough. There was no fixing the blisters and skin rashes between events. All I could do was pop Ibruprofin and Tylenol. We started the Tough at Pointe Du Hoc where about 150 Army Rangers were killed trying to take the highest point between Utah and Omaha Beaches. Again, we were loaded up with as much heavy shit as we could carry (sand bags, poles, anything the cadre could find) on top of the 40 pound rucks we were required to have on our backs. We began to walk. One hour became three which became ten. I reached one of the darkest places my mind has ever gone.

As the sun began to rise we reached Omaha Beach where, again, we had to re-enact the troops emptying out of Higgins boats and storming the beach. The water was some of the most frigid I had ever encountered. Unlike the Heavy event where we immediately started the hike, the cadre set us down for an hour to give us a history of Omaha Beach. Sounds nice, right? A history lesson instead of carrying heavy shit mile after mile?

No, this is where the dark got darker. Because we didn’t get PTed or forced to hike, we remained soaking wet in the frigid cold, sitting on the beach as the cold air blew in. All manliness left as I snuggled up closer to my partner in pain, Hotspot. I couldn’t stop shaking. I was cold to my core. I started feeling what I thought was hypothermia. I didn’t honestly know what that felt like, but I was pretty sure I was there. It was, with all honesty, as dark as my mind has ever gotten. I considered quitting the HTL right then and there.

<img class=""alignnone wp-image-6695"" src=""https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/safsdfasd.jpg"" alt="""" width=""494"" height=""328"" />
How could it get any worse? Seriously. That’s what I asked myself sitting on Omaha Beach. How can it get any worse? Are you EFFING kidding me? What kind of little bitch ass thing is that to think?

Obviously this is just a movie, but let me show you how it can get A HELL OF A LOT WORSE!

https://youtu.be/X-bogN0V8RM

I could be an 18-year-old kid who is leaving his mother for the first time. I could really be jumping out of a Higgins boat, not just pretending, after puking my guts out and being drug to the ocean floor by ruck and weapon. I could be making to the beach where Nazis are trying to blow my face off. I could be laying on the beach after being struck by a mortar, my leg just blown off and screaming for my mother.

Right here, in this very spot where I sit, men and even kids poured their blood and their literal lives into the sand and I’m sitting here bitching about blisters, rashes and the cold. They did it to save Europe and to ensure that Hitler’s regime never reached America. This was the counterattack. Right here. This turned the war. This saved the world. This was too hallowed ground for me to quit. Hell, it was too hallowed for me to even whine or feel sorry for myself.

That’s where my mind went. Everything got brighter and I found the energy to carry on. Every single step that got me to the finish line was fueled by the thought of those heroes.",,2018-06-06,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/the-most-little-bitch-thing-ive-ever-thought/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Image-uploaded-from-iOS-4-2.jpg|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wet-and-cold-photo-cred-vincent-lee.jpg|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Image-uploaded-from-iOS-4-1.jpg|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wet-and-cold-photo-cred-vincent-lee-1.jpg|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/safsdfasd.jpg,"Image uploaded from iOS (4)||||",||||,||||,||||,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Image-uploaded-from-iOS-4-2.jpg,,Blog,,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,the-most-little-bitch-thing-ive-ever-thought,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-06-06
6727,"5 Digital Tips For Political Campaigns","We’re expanding, taking on more advocacy projects and corporate clients, but political campaigns are in our DNA. We can’t just rip out a part of our DNA. We’re told that biology doesn't work like that.

Political campaigns may work us to death, spend way too much money on TV, sometimes not even pay their bills and have the loyalty of Little Finger from Game of Thrones, but we’re in for the long haul. There are too many problems in this world that need fixing for us to just turn our backs on the leaders who actually have the power to fix them.

Why am I telling you all this? Because in the past six months I’ve heard no less than 50 times “you guys still do political campaigns?”

YES! We still do political campaigns. We’re one of the premier Republican digital agencies in the nation. We’re just getting more selective about who we work with because life is too short to work for people who aren’t serious about the monumental problems facing our city, our state, our nation and especially our planet.

So, while we’re busy working on our selective political client list, we’re still throwing out a lot of free advice to all the Republican political campaigns out there. Here’s some new awesomeness from Phil Vangelakos who leads our political division.

6753,"5 Reasons Why Mark Sanford Lost","[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSfYVrxhdVw&feature=youtu.be[/embed]

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At 4:12 pm, President Donald Trump sent out this tweet in the midst of South Carolina’s primary election day...</span>

<img class="" wp-image-6754 aligncenter"" src=""https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-22-at-1.31.04-PM-1024x513.png"" alt="""" width=""516"" height=""259"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The polls closed at 7 pm. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A few hours later, freshman state legislator Katie Arrington shockingly defeated Congressman Mark Sanford, with some pundits claiming the defeat was the result of the “Trump Effect.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So, was Trump really responsible for this outcome? The short answer is no. A last minute tweet by President Trump did not cause a mass exodus of people rush to the polls to vote Arrington for Congress. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So, how was Arrington able to defeat Sanford? Here are the five reasons.</span>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Strength vs Weakness</strong></li>
</ol>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The personality trait the GOP wants most is <em>strength</em>. They want strong leaders with strong personalities. Terry Sullivan, a political consultant, <a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/news/rubio-campaign-manager-gop-no-longer-ideological-compass-191842695.html"">told Yahoo News the GOP has lost its ideological compass</a>, explaining how Republicans care more about personality than ideas.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the race between Arrington and Sanford, Katie Arrington came across as a strong female ready to take on the role as Congresswoman while Mark Sanford, as usual, came across as an ideologue and frankly, a very weak man. When you think Mark Sanford, the last thing you think of is strength. From his famous Appalachian Trail hike disappearance to his admittance of engaging in an extramarital affair to crying on national TV, Sanford has epitomized what it means to be weak.</span>
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li><strong> Sanford Didn't Take Arrington Seriously Until It Was Too Late</strong></li>
</ol>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mark Sanford got out worked. Big time. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We didn't hear anything from Sanford for weeks while Katie was working her tail off. She was everywhere. Her signs were everywhere. She was all over TV. She was all over the Internet. She was physically all over the district attending pretty much any meeting where two or more people gathered. The lady straight up worked her ass off.  </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On the other hand, even when he wasn't in Washington, Sanford was nowhere to be found until about the last three weeks of the race when he finally decided to start spending some of his huge war chest on TV and start showing up in the community. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The weekend before the election we finally saw him with his head out in Summerville. He was walking around the local farmers market with no staff, no literature, no stickers and barely talking to people. On second thought, he may have just been buying vegetables. Regardless, Sanford wasn’t nearly as present as Arrington was.</span>
<ol start=""3"">
 	<li><strong> Sanford Didn't Have A Real Campaign Or A Ground Game.</strong></li>
</ol>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Did Sanford have a campaign manager? A communications director? A political director? Nobody knows. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All indications are that he did not have a campaign at all and if he did, we sure didn't see it. He must have thought he could win with a last minute TV blitz alone. Big mistake.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As the owner of one of the nations most prominent Republican digital agencies, you'd expect me to say that grassroots politics is dead and that you should throw all your money online. Well, that's horseshit. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ground games win close elections and this one was close. Arrington put together an excellent campaign team that concentrated on grassroots. She didn't just outwork Sanford alone. She put together a badass </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">team</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that outworked Sanford.</span>
<ol start=""4"">
 	<li><strong> Mark Sanford Left Too Much Money In The Bank</strong></li>
</ol>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sanford is notoriously cheap. He doesn't like to spend money. However, he could have hired a great team for a small amount of money. Why? Because in campaigns, people are the cheapest thing you can buy. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sanford has one of the best TV firms in the nation. He could have leaned on them more and been on TV months earlier. He could have effectively drowned Arrington out. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But instead, Sanford left over $1 million in the bank. Let that sink in. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One. Million. Dollars. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That's just campaign negligence.</span>
<ol start=""5"">
 	<li><strong> President Trump.</strong></li>
</ol>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">President Trump endorsed Arrington once it didn’t matter anymore. His endorsement tweet came at the last minute, when he already saw she was going to win. What President Trump did do was sit back and let Mark Sanford attack him. And in South Carolina, that's enough.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Every South Carolina GOP primary poll I've seen in 2018 indicates that the number one issue voters care about is loyalty to President Trump. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sanford stood his ideological ground and took numerous shots at President Trump. Arrington used that in every way she could, including on TV. She is a Trump loyalist. Sanford is a Trump antagonist. And right now in South Carolina, the loyalists will prevail.</span>",,2018-06-25,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/5-reasons-why-mark-sanford-lost/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/180622_Wesley_WhySanfordLost_964x428.png|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-22-at-1.31.04-PM.png,"180622_Wesley_WhySanfordLost_964x428|Screen Shot 2018-06-22 at 1.31.04 PM",|,|,|,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/180622_Wesley_WhySanfordLost_964x428.png,,Blog,,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,5-reasons-why-mark-sanford-lost,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-06-25

6802,"Does It Matter? - Digital Platforms Edition","Anybody who's somebody is on social media. It's how people keep up with each other and how people express themselves.

People use social media for everything, from posting their latest vacation photos to posting what they ate for dinner to getting into heated political debates over Trump's latest tweet.

Social media has taken the world by storm.

So, what role does social media play in a political campaign?

Social media has the power to drastically change the course of an election. However, that's only if you know what platforms to use and how to use them.

By using social media, politicians can connect to voters in a way that has never been done before, by responding to questions and current events in real time.

Politicians should be taking advantage of the fact that they have a direct line of communication to voters. But, with so many different digital platforms out there, it's important to know which ones are worth your time and energy, especially if you're running a political campaign.

6817,"There Is No Excuse For Not Publishing Awesome Content","“I don’t like to be on camera.”

“I don’t write well.”

There is always an excuse. For anything. For everything.

That’s certainly true when it comes to putting out great content. We hear these excuses over and over again. The truth is that everyone has a talent. Everyone has a way of expressing themselves. Everyone can pump out awesome content, if they have something awesome to say.

My excuse is that I don’t have time to write. I love writing. But with meetings, calls, staff interruptions, a wife and two boys always wanting my attention, I just can’t find the time to sit down, clear my head and put the words on paper. That’s why I pump out so many videos. It’s not that I love seeing myself on camera. I typically cringe every time I see my crooked nose. It’s just easy and something I can do in 10 minutes between the chaos.

That brings me to our lead graphic designer, JP Phillips. JP is as introverted as they come. He would say he has “overwhelming social anxiety.” When we tasked every staffer with taking over our Instagram Story for one day and it was his turn, JP didn’t come to me with an excuse. He used his amazing talent as an illustrator to express himself in a completely unique and amazing way.

I’m super stoked to share with you JP’s Instagram Story highlighting his day at Push Digital...

6842,"Branding 101","If I had to guess, you’re currently consuming an overpriced Starbucks drink while scrolling through this article on an Apple device. Have you ever stopped to think about why these companies are so popular and widely recognized? It’s about more than just <em>good coffee</em> and <em>efficient technology</em>. It’s about how they’ve successfully branded themselves!

Branding is one of the most vital aspects in developing a company. It’s a company’s identity. It’s who they are and how the rest of the world sees them.

Push Digital may have started as an exclusively political agency, but we’ve continued to expand into consumer brand marketing and advocacy! From logo design, to videography, to websites — we’ve got the creative chops to take on any task.

We pride ourselves in our ability to <strong>create a company’s identity</strong> through a detailed process.

For PUSH Digital, branding is more than just designing a logo or developing a website. It’s about connecting with a client, creating their identity, determining their mission, and executing a plan of action.

It’s about getting to know every single part of a brand, but it’s also about the brand getting to know us. It’s about figuring out what the brand needs and how we can meet those needs. It’s about using the incredibly talented designers we have and showcasing their unique skills.

The branding process at Push is <strong>tailored to each individual client</strong>, paying close attention to their wants and needs. The process is broken down into three phases:
<ol>
 	<li>Discovery Phase</li>
 	<li>Production Phase</li>
 	<li>Marketing Phase</li>
</ol>
The<b> Discovery Phase</b> is essentially like speed-dating. We try to get as much information about our clients as possible through a series of conversations and interviews. In doing so, we’re able to create a creative blueprint that is used in the last two phases to ensure our content is cohesive.

The <b>Production Phase</b> is all about development. Whether it’s developing a brand’s logo or a company’s website, the production phase puts pen to paper…or hand to computer mouse. It involves drawing the logos, selecting fonts and colors, building wireframes, etc, all of which involves close contact with the respective client to refine any and all details.

Now, you have your final product! Your logo and/or website is finally created! That’s it, right? No.

You’d think we’d stop there, but we don’t. We don’t just build your content, we market it, too.

The <b>Marketing Phase</b> calls on our top-of-the-line marketing and advertising teams, who are ready to drive continuous engagements to your content. They work closely with our clients to determine who they want to target and how they can best target them. This means that we are guaranteed to generate the best ROI possible.

Throughout these various phases, we work to find ways to differentiate a brand from other markets in similar fields.

In short, <strong>Push Digital pushes the limits</strong> when it comes to branding.",,2018-07-27,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/branding-101/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/180720_Branding_101_Twitter.jpg,180720_Branding_101_Twitter,,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/180720_Branding_101_Twitter.jpg,,Blog,"branding|brands|digital marketing|marketing|Push|push digital",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,branding-101,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-07-27
6853,"Branding: Getting To Know You","Arguably, one of the most important phases of the branding process at Push is the <strong>Discovery Phase</strong>!

The Discovery Phase is exactly what it sounds like - discovering everything we possibly can about your company and future goals! We achieve this by using our <em>tried-and-true process</em>, which uses a combination of conversation and collaborative online questionnaires to establish a solid foundation for your project.

Throughout these conversations, we work to figure out everything we can about a client - their purpose, audience, goals, timeline, challenges - everything that could help us get closer to determining who they currently are and who they want to become.

One of the most helpful tools we use are <strong>questionnaires</strong>!

Questionnaires are created by account executives and tailored to each client. Each questionnaire involves a comprehensive list of questions about the business itself, their customers, and their identity.

After reading and analyzing the responses to the questionnaire, our account executives then create a <strong>baseline assessment</strong>. This assessment essentially reviews a company’s existing brand experience and story, including culture, benefits, values, and target audience - all of which provide the groundwork for our plan of action.

In addition, we also survey a brand’s <em>competitive landscape</em>, looking at both direct and potential competitors. This helps us determine industry norms, which can further identify visual cues, opportunities, and things to avoid.

All of these steps are then combined to create a brand’s <strong>Creative Blueprint</strong>. This blueprint is a guiding document that aids our account executives and designers in determining their direction.

The Creative Blueprint is our direction forward. Each blueprint restates client directives on style, asset needs, and content, which are then translated into timelines. It helps us and our clients visualize what we’re saying in design-speak, so to say.

Overall, the Discovery Phase is our way of <em>becoming a part of the brand</em>. It’s not just about listening to what a client wants and executing it, it’s about listening and understanding how we can grow and improve the brand - short-term and long-term. It’s about using our knowledge and experience to determine how we can differentiate a brand in their market.

The Discovery Phase highlights the brand’s most important features and challenges - all of which provide us with the tools we need to embark on the next phase of the branding process, the <strong>Production Phase!</strong>",,2018-08-06,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/branding-getting-to-know-you/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/180124_Wesley_Wont_Stop_482.jpg,"Wesley Donehue Writing","Wesley Donehue Writing",,"Wesley Donehue Writing",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/180124_Wesley_Wont_Stop_482.jpg,,Blog,"branding|brands|communications|digital|digital marketing|marketing|push digital",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,branding-getting-to-know-you,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-08-06

Tone doesn’t always come across correctly in writing so let me say from the very first sentence that this post is not meant to be argumentative or critical in any way. It is simply a debate about creative design and an explanation for our branding choices at Frothy Beard Brewing Company.

I am a partner in Frothy Beard Brewing and the owner of Push Digital, a 45 person marketing agency physically connected to Frothy Beard. I personally oversee all Frothy Beard creative and marketing. Beer and brewery branding is something I’m very passionate about.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A couple weeks ago an article was published in the Charleston Post and Courier discussing <a href=""https://www.postandcourier.com/food/charleston-s-craft-breweries-embrace-the-artistic-possibilities-of-beer/article_3030fde4-699b-11e8-a1d8-3396b03abba2.html"">craft brewery can art in the Charleston, SC</a> brewing community. Then, I sent out a <a href=""https://twitter.com/wesleydonehue/status/1024702074049765376"">few tweets with my thoughts</a> about can art. This week Schmoll Creative launched their second annual <a href=""https://www.schmollcreative.com/branding/brewerybattlevol2/?utm_source=schmoll+creative&amp;utm_campaign=55e9c7043d-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_08_08_02_40&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_5cd6ebe4c9-55e9c7043d-322542953"">“Battle of the Brewery Brands”</a> in which they discussed the topic again. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Schmoll kindly sent us to the second round, beating out Palmetto Brewing. Thank you, Schmoll! We deeply appreciate the compliments. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">About our can design, <a href=""https://www.schmollcreative.com/branding/brewerybattlevol2/?utm_source=schmoll+creative&amp;utm_campaign=55e9c7043d-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_08_08_02_40&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_5cd6ebe4c9-55e9c7043d-322542953"">Schmoll wrote,</a> ""local artist <a href=""https://tamiboyce.com/design/frothy-beard-posters-sketches/"">Tami Boyce</a> draws the adorable illustrations that can be found on Frothy’s branding and marketing materials, giving the brewery a recognizable and truely unique look. The cans use the main Frothy-man face over a printed background on the front and single-color beer-specific illustration on the back. Although we appreciate the consistency, we feel Frothy is missing an opportunity to use Tami’s more elaborate drawings and scenes for a little extra fun.""</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We agree about Tami. She’s AMAZING. When I’m feeling down at work, I will simply step into the tap room and just look at her posters. They put positive vibes in my heart. Please go check her out <a href=""https://tamiboyce.com/design/frothy-beard-posters-sketches/"">here.</a></span>

&nbsp;

<img class=""wp-image-6899 alignleft"" src=""https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC05543-1024x684.jpg"" alt="""" width=""368"" height=""246"" /><img class=""wp-image-6893 aligncenter"" src=""https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Victorious-Wolf-Double-IPA-Poster_HR-683x1024.jpg"" alt="""" width=""211"" height=""316"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Despite my love for Tami, there is a reason we don’t use her art for our cans.  It’s the same reason I haven’t asked her to paint a big mural on the front of the building. Instead we have this...</span>

<img class=""wp-image-6902 aligncenter"" src=""https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/26166079_1768191033205862_2976789128596107267_n.jpg"" alt="""" width=""365"" height=""353"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We have about .5 seconds to catch someone’s attention when he or she drives by Frothy on Sam Rittenberg Blvd at 45 MPH.  They need to see the big branding. That’s it. That’s all they have time to see. They aren’t going to stop and stare at the mural like they are visiting Mona Lisa at the Louvre. Art has someone’s full attention. Marketing rarely does. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The same goes for cans on a shelf. However, in this case, the cans are surrounded by other cans. Not only does the branding have to stand out when someone is quickly walking by a shelf, but it also must stand about among a lot of other branding that’s also on that shelf when someone is standing 10 feet away.</span>

<img class=""alignnone wp-image-6896"" src=""https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_4226-2-1024x824.jpg"" alt="""" width=""335"" height=""270"" />    <img class=""alignnone wp-image-6897"" src=""https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_6713-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" width=""364"" height=""273"" />

I love a lot of other breweries in Charleston, but my favorite can art is from Coast and Revelry. The designs are both fun and beautiful. However, you can’t even see the companys’ branding unless you are actually staring at that individual can. Perhaps that’s what someone does when they are actually drinking from the can, but that’s not normal consumer behavior when they are in a grocery store trying to make a quick choice.

Consumers engage in little, if any, deliberation as they stroll through the grocery store. Studies have shown that <a href=""http://journal.sjdm.org/11/10420a/jdm10420a.pdf"">""consumers can make decisions in as little as a third of a second.""</a> These decisions are primarily based on the products that grab a consumer's attention and incorporate everything from product color to product placement.

It’s all about attention and in this case, the attention goes to the branding that pops the loudest. SIMPLE and BOLD works best on a shelf. Pretty, detailed art does not.  By the way, this is my same theory about tap handles. While I disagree with Revelry’s choice about can design, I totally agree with their tap handle choice because the red bugle stands out better than almost any tap handle in the Charleston market.

I totally agree with Schmoll that our cans aren’t the prettiest and that Tami could absolutely crush pretty can design like she did our barrel aged Mermaid’s Milk bottle design (limited edition and didn’t go on shelves). However, I don’t want pretty. I want our cans to pop off a shelf and for someone to see our logo and name. That’s what’s most important in this specific instance.

I often have to remind my design team (primarily working on digital content) that they have to look through the eyes of the consumer. They are designing images on a big screen and taking a lot of time to work on the details. They’re artists. That’s what artists do. It’s about detail. However, consumers are looking at those images on a mobile device while doing 100 other things like driving a car while their kids are screaming and that art is surrounded by a bunch of other art.

6919,"I Must UnEFF My Mind","It’s been a good while since I wrote about my Ironman journey. I’ve been concentrating on pumping out a ton of work-related content recently with a goal of one new piece of content every day. I’ve been documenting my wannabe endurance athlete journey on Instagram stories. I hope you’ll follow me there.

I’m currently in the air flying to Los Angeles so, I thought this would be a good time to deep dive into where I find myself just five weeks shy of my first full Ironman on September 30.

I’m in the best shape of my life. I’m strong and lean. My cardio endurance is at an all-time high. I’m dialing in my nutrition. My mobility is still horrible but it’s getting better. I haven’t been injured or, what has been more common for me, sick (I’ve considered keeping Harlowe out of school until October 1). I’m getting technically better in the water and on the bike.

The problem - and excuse my French - is that my mind is totally EFFed. Success on September 30 depends on whether or not I can unEFF my mind in the next 38 days.

<strong>The Swim</strong>

I’m getting better in the water and really, seeing that I didn’t know how to swim last year and I’ve already knocked out two 70.3, one Olympic and six sprint triathlons, I’m kind of proud of myself. I’ve put in a ton of time. My technique is getting better and if I could just get my shoulders fixed, I think I could actually be a good swimmer. As for the shoulders, for you that haven’t read my previous stuff, I am unable to get my body flat in the water because I can’t extend my arms straight over my head. That means I swim very inefficiently.

To remedy the mobility issue, I am stretching for an hour every day and I just started massage therapy with an emphasis on cupping. It’s getting better but the truth is that I should have started this a year ago. The mobility issue is definitely keeping me back but that’s not the ultimate problem. My mind is.

I have a busy mind. A very busy mind. It runs at warp speed at all times. Constantly thinking. Never chilling. Meditation is helping. Prayer is helping. But, when I start swimming I get bored as hell because there is nothing to preoccupy my mind. There is nothing to look at like when I’m biking or running. It’s just me and my thoughts. I start thinking about how bad my shoulders hurt when I extend. I start thinking about how I can’t breathe. I start panicking. I stop.

It has happened in every single race. I never keep swimming. I get in my own head. I tell myself I can’t make it the whole way. I’m drowning. I need to turn over, float on my back and catch my breath.

I know none of that is true as I sit here writing this but I can’t shake it during a race. Even in the pool, I stop at the wall for too long because I’m just sick of looking at the floor. My mind is EFFed and I’m not exactly sure how to fix it.

<strong>The Bike</strong>

I completed an 85-mile ride with a 6-mile run this weekend. I felt great. My legs haven’t been a problem. My energy level remains high. I’m getting stronger and faster. I've planned my first-century ride (100 miles) this weekend.

The problem here is two-fold. First, my mobility is a problem on the bike, too. My back, shoulders, and neck are so tense that around mile 50 I start having severe pain. During my 70.3 mile triathlon two weeks ago, my neck actually started having spasms and I had to get off the bike to stretch. I’m really hoping the stretching, massage and cupping help here. I’ve also been researching how to sit differently or stretch while I’m actually on the bike.

The bigger problem on the bike is, again, my mind. I had a nasty crash last year and now high speeds freak me out. I get wobbly around 20 mph. I jump out of aero position because I’m convinced I’m going to crash and die. I’m being a complete wuss. I’m very ashamed of myself. I thought I was stronger than this.

My last 70.3 two weeks ago was up around Asheville, NC with brutal hills. The funny thing is that I was passing everyone going uphill. You wouldn’t think that was the case because I live in a flat area, but come to find out, my legs are pretty strong. The problem is that when I go downhill, I ride my breaks the entire time. Not only does it cost me a TON of time but it also tenses up my back, shoulders, and neck - a big reason I had those spasms. My legs are strong but my mind is weak.

<strong>The Run</strong>

Not a whole lot to report here except that I’m running well, right now. I’m having no pains and losing ten pounds has made me a lot lighter on my feet. I haven’t run more than 14 miles in recent weeks but I have already knocked out the Disney Dopey, Paris Marathon and the Palmetto 200 on an ultra team this year. I know I need to get some long runs in before my race, especially coming off the bike, but I’m not overly concerned here. I’m going to knock out an 18 miler this week and a 20 miler next week. What I really need to do is run without music because it’s not allowed at Ironman. Again... back to it being mental. Are you seeing a trend yet?

<strong>Nutrition</strong>

I’m feeling super good here. I’ve been on a ketogenic diet, along with daily intermittent fasting, for almost two months. I’m down ten pounds and I’m getting fat adapted (training my body to burn fat instead of carbs). I’m eating carbs only on my weekly cheat day and before the very long workouts. I’m only about two pounds from my goal weight so, I’m adding fruits and vegetables back into my daily diet, which I’ve been avoiding because of the sugar.

For those of you playing with a keto diet...I think it’s a great short-term diet to lose weight fast. I do not, however, believe that a high-fat diet leads to long-term strong health. I’m working toward a more balanced diet without complex carbs, sugar, and processed bullshit.

Now for the hardest part of all. It’s not training. It’s not diet. It’s BOOZE. I mean, shit, I own a brewery. Do you know how hard it is for me to not drink at least a couple beers every single day? I’m super stoked that last week I only had alcohol two out of seven days. That’s pretty impressive for me. I’m trying again this week for only two days and I’m strongly considering laying off alcohol completely for the 30 days before Ironman. Can I actually complete a Sober September?  If I do, I should get a medal for that too.

Thank you for your continued support and POSITIVE VIBES!",,2018-08-22,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/i-must-uneff-my-mind/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/180822_Donehue_Design_IronmanBlog_2.png|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2016-07-13-1468421604-4642908-IronmanLogo.jpg,180822_Donehue_Design_IronmanBlog_2|2016-07-13-1468421604-4642908-IronmanLogo,|,|,|,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/180822_Donehue_Design_IronmanBlog_2.png,,Blog,bike|Fitness|ironman|marathon|run|swim,publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,i-must-uneff-my-mind,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-08-22
6926,"You Must Know THIS Before Starting a Digital Marketing Campaign","I recently gave a talk to around 50 business leaders with the Charleston, SC Chamber of Commerce right here at Push Digital. Rather than talk specifically about platform tactics, I decided to go super high level because I have recently realized that most folks dive into their marketing campaigns without considering the environment in which they are playing. They completely ignore the foundation, building a house on sand instead of the rock that can strengthen their entire structure.

I start by talking about what everyone knows - digital and technology has completely disrupted a number of industries. Most people fail to realize that these disruptions have happened and continue to happen because WE as a species, not just as industries, are changing. Our most basic inherited social behaviors are changing – the way we hang out with friends, the way we interact with our loved ones, even the way we meet our mates and produce offspring. Digital marketing and technology aren't just disrupting industries, they're disrupting humans.

Why?<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>The one word that matters most – ATTENTION. All, and I do mean ALL, of our attention are on the little computers, video cameras, phones and media companies in our pockets. This means every action we take is being tracked, sold to data companies and available for marketing agencies, like mine, to harness. And THAT folks, is the whole ballgame when it comes to marketing.

When you understand:

1. how technology has disrupted basic human behavior,<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>

2. the way people are living their lives on, and giving their full attention to, mobile devices and;<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span>

3. the data and opportunity that gives marketers...

then and only then, can you create an effective digital campaign in 2018.

6941,"How TV and Digital Should Work Together","<div>

&nbsp;

Ten years ago, digital gurus and ninjas claimed that digital marketing was going to replace TV marketing. I always made a different bet. I said that instead of replacing TV, digital would actually merge into TV. Today, you see that I was right.

TV marketing is changing as more people cut the cord - by buying smart TVs and watching videos on mobile devices. TV content is still there. It’s just being consumed differently.

</div>
<div></div>
<div>So, how should TV and digital work together?</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
&nbsp;
<div><img class=""wp-image-6949 aligncenter"" src=""https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/180111_Wesley_Blog_TVDigital_StockImages-03.png"" alt="""" width=""700"" height=""350"" /></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>

&nbsp;

<strong>1. Television is your air war. Digital is your ground war.</strong>

</div>
<div>
<div>

Television is air war where you drop big bombs on large populations of people. Digital is your special forces operation where you go household to household, directly to individual targets. TV is for broad messaging that will appeal to a lot of people in a DMA. Digital is for driving specific messages to niche audiences of people with very tailored messaging.

</div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>

&nbsp;

<img class=""wp-image-6426 aligncenter"" src=""https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/180314_Push_Website_964x482.jpg"" alt=""Push Digital Just Leveled Up"" width=""700"" height=""350"" />

&nbsp;

<strong>2. Increase TV message frequency with digital.</strong>
<div>
<div>

Your marketing budget is a simple formula of Reach + Frequency. The more people you hit and the more times you need to hit them, the larger your budget will be. You can make your television buys more cost effective through increasing your reach by supplementing TV buys online. That way people will see them on multiple platforms, dramatically increasing message recall.

</div>
<div></div>
</div>
&nbsp;
<div></div>
<div><img class=""wp-image-6946 aligncenter"" src=""https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/180111_Wesley_Blog_TVDigital_StockImages-01.png"" alt="""" width=""700"" height=""350"" /></div>
&nbsp;
<div>
<div>

<strong>3. Find the TV cord cutters with digital.</strong>

</div>
<div>
<div>

The old cable subscription model is falling apart as more people are opting for smart televisions or digital connected televisions. Don’t think this is just a trend for the youngsters. It’s happening across the board.

</div>
<div>

You want these people with a broadcast or traditional cable buy so those dollars must be allocated to a supplemental digital buy.

</div>
<div></div>
</div>
&nbsp;

</div>
<div></div>
<div><img class=""wp-image-6947 aligncenter"" src=""https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/180111_Wesley_Blog_TVDigital_StockImages-02.png"" alt="""" width=""700"" height=""350"" /></div>
<div>
<div>
<div></div>
<div>

&nbsp;

<strong>4. Decide the percentage based on the market.</strong>

</div>
<div>
<div>

Never listen to a digital expert who throws out a blanket number like 20% when asked “how much money in a campaign should be allocated to digital?” There is not an overarching answer. It all depends on the district.

</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>

This year we helped with a US Senate race in West Virginia. We could not, in good faith, argue for less money on TV and more on digital because in West Virginia, TV is dirt cheap. However, we are currently running a lot of digital ads around Manhattan where TV costs are astronomically high. And, while digital ads are still expensive, they are at least affordable. In West Virginia we had about 10% of the marketing budget but in New York we have closer to 80%.

6968,"You Won’t Suck The Positivity Out","<h3>I won’t let you.</h3>
I’ve made a commitment to myself, my team and my family. People who suck positivity out of our day will be eliminated.

Friends, acquaintances, family outside our home, staff, clients... it doesn’t matter. Negativity will not be tolerated. The vampires, who suck joy, will be taken out.

Maybe not immediately. I believe in second chances. Positivity can take over the most lost soul, if its allowed.

That’s the key. We must actively fight the negativity. We must turn away and desire the positivity. We must not accept the Internet fighting, cable news drama and reality TV lifestyle.

To accept is to allow your heart to be consumed with darkness. It invades homes and offices. It kills joy and productivity. It becomes a virus that spreads to every nearby heart.

To fight is to immediately turn away from negative energy. Allow the positivity to flow so that it can fill your heart with joy and fuel creativity, collaboration and success.

Allow the positivity and you will be accepted. Become a vampire who sucks out our joy and you’ll be turned away. It’s that simple. That’s how it is.

We’ve recently posted this sign in our office conference room to let everyone know.

6977,"What’s Your 25 Year Plan?","<h4>The most overwhelming question ever.</h4>
I’m huge on goals. Five year goals. One year goals. Monthly goals. Weekly goals. Daily goals. I live by them. I accomplish monumental things I used to think were pipe dreams because everything I do is based on a goal. If something comes across my plate that doesn’t work toward a goal, then I eliminate it.

People ask me every single day - how do you get so much done?

It’s not easy but it’s certainly calculated. I set goals, break them up into smaller goals and then set daily tasks. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time... just don’t tell PETA.

But, while I preach goal setting at every opportunity, there is a question that overwhelms me to the point of complete inaction - what is your 25 year plan?

My financial advisor always asks it. It’s a question that is always in my face, staring me down. How do you plan for your long term future when you don’t know what you want that future to look like?

Today, it’s inescapable because I’m at a two day business retreat with that being the overarching topic. I’m supposed to figure that shit out and start planning.

This retreat is being held on Hilton Head Island. I drove here from Summerville. I set the destination in my Waze app. It showed me the course. I drove.

Without knowing the destination, I could have ended up in Greenville or Wilmington or Savannah. But I made it just fine to Hilton Head because I knew my destination and followed the path.

That’s also how I became a marathoner, an Ironman, an entrepreneur and a father. But, for some dang reason, I just can’t think beyond ten years. It’s just too big.

So, that’s what I’m doing today. I’ll report back soon with the tips and tricks I learn.

6988,"Developing Your 25 Year Plan","<div dir=""auto"">

I just arrived back in the office from a two day retreat with my Forum group in Hilton Head, SC. As I wrote on Monday, I was completely overwhelmed with the proposition of figuring out where I would be when I am sixty-three years old. People change. I’ll change. I have no idea WHO I will be at sixty-three, much less where I will be.

</div>
<div dir=""auto"">

But, I can’t let that scare me. I must have a goal. You must have a goal. To be goalless is to be stagnant. A destination must first be determined before a course can be mapped. Only then can we start moving.

</div>
<div dir=""auto"">

We were given a worksheet that made the idea of a 25 year plan much more digestible. I was amazed by how much progress I made by answering these very large, but easily answerable questions:

In the classic <em>Think and Grow Rich</em>, Napoleon Hill explains the concept of “My Definite Chief Aim.” He wrote “anything the mind can conceive and believe it can be achieved.” He continued “any definite chief aim that is deliberately fixed in the mind and held there, with the determination to realize it, finally saturates the entire subconscious mind until it automatically influences the physical action of the body toward the attainment of that purpose.”

</div>
<div dir=""auto"">

Successful people know what they want and they hustle for it. They have an aim. They study the aim. They memorize the aim. They don’t get distracted by things outside of their aim.

</div>
<div dir=""auto"">

One prime example, and the model for Hill’s format of the Chief Aim, was Bruce Lee. He wrote:

</div>
<div dir=""auto""></div>
<div dir=""auto""></div>
<div dir=""auto""><img class=""alignnone size-large wp-image-7008"" src=""https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Image-from-iOS-10-806x1024.jpg"" alt="""" width=""806"" height=""1024"" /></div>
<div dir=""auto""></div>
&nbsp;

“I, Bruce Lee, will be the first highest paid Oriental super star in the United States. In return I will give the most exciting performances and render the best of quality in the capacity of an actor. Starting 1970 I will achieve world fame and from then onward till the end of 1980 I will have in my possession $10,000,000. I will live the way I please and achieve inner harmony and happiness.""
<div dir=""auto"">

Hill writes that you should follow Lee’s example and:

</div>
<ol>
 	<li>
<div>Be specific.</div></li>

7011,"Do Not Attempt Without A Supportive Spouse","I’m in a men’s Bible study group that meets once a month. Each month we are tasked with a number of different homework assignments, including reading a book, praying and one thing related to our spouses. This past month we were given around 50 different character traits and asked to circle three, and only three, traits that best describe our wives.

Obviously, I circled “train smoke hot.” Okay, it just said “sexy.” But before that I first circled “supportive.”

I work 60+ hours per week. Even when I’m not in the office my brain is always working. I haven’t built my businesses because I’m the smartest person. I’ve built them through pure hustle.

The same goes for my athletic adventures. I’m not a natural athlete. I’m not fast or strong. I never played sports growing up. I’ve run lots of marathons, completed a brutal GORUCK HTL and become an IRONMAN by putting in the hours. The last three weeks of my IRONMAN training saw me training 20+ hours each week.

I’ve stayed focused. I’ve worked my ass off. But these aren’t accomplishments I’ve tackled on my own. They are also accomplishments for my wife, Elizabeth.

Let me state as clear as I can - DO NOT ATTEMPT entrepreneurship, crazy endurance events or any other huge time sucking endeavor without a spouse as supportive as mine.

I bring home money. I help out around the house. I watch the boys so that Elizabeth can also tackle her goals. But make no mistake about it - Elizabeth keeps our lives together. She keeps the house together. She pays the bills. She keeps the schedule. She handles the boys. She has my back at all times.

I’m out of the bed by 4 am and out the door by 5 am. I go hard all day and often have late work events. I often live out of airports and hotels. I disappear for over five hours at a time on weekends for long training days. I drop lots of money signing up for events, buying equipment and training. Never does she complain.

Don’t get me wrong. I’m not an absent husband or father. They come first. All I’m saying is that I’ve heard other spouses complain about their husbands (or wives) doing similar things and those folks are unable to do what I do because they catch a lot of shit about it.

I don’t disappear to golf, hunt or fish like a lot of my buddies, but I do disappear. And, 98% of the time my wife is cool as a cucumber about it. I mean I’m not going to lie here. Maybe twice a year she will get fed up with it. She is human after all. But man, when I think about it, I’m one of the luckiest men in the world to have found a wife like Elizabeth.

As I’m writing this post, I’m finding it hard to put it all into words. I’m not being very articulate. Let me let Elizabeth speak for herself. Watch this video from mile 18 of my IRONMAN marathon run.  I was in so much pain. I had been throwing up. I got so overheated that I started having chills. Listen to the support I got from my wife...

[KGVID]https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1153.mov[/KGVID]

This isn’t a rare occurrence. She wasn’t being this supportive because I was in the middle of the race. This is always Elizabeth. She’s pushes me to do better and to be better. She encourages me when I’m down and singularly picks me back up.

In summary, make sure your spouse:
<ol>
 	<li>Is bought in on the goal</li>
 	<li>Understands your commitment</li>
 	<li>Understands what it will put on them</li>
 	<li>Understands the financial cost</li>
 	<li>Most importantly - will be your cheerleader when you need it most</li>
</ol>
Everything I am is because of Elizabeth. Every accomplishment is also hers.",,2018-10-22,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/do-not-attempt-without-a-supportive-spouse/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/181022_Wesley_SupportiveSpouse_964x482.png,"Wesley Donehue Family Photos","Wesley Donehue Family Photos","Wesley Donehue Family Photos","Wesley Donehue Family Photos",https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/181022_Wesley_SupportiveSpouse_964x482.png,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1153.mov,Blog,"spouse|support|supporty system",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,do-not-attempt-without-a-supportive-spouse,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-10-22

7026,"5 Things To Know Before Starting Your Fitness Journey","Learn From My Mistakes

This morning, I led our F3 workout and noticed some sloppy burpees happening. I decided to pen this quick note to my F3 brothers. Then I decided you may be able to use this knowledge also so I decided to also publish it here. For those of you who do not know, F3 stands for Fitness, Fellowship and Faith. It’s an early morning free workout group. It’s peer led. I am a different person because of F3.

Please forgive the language —&gt; again, it was written for a bunch of men.

_______________________________________

Smart people learn from their mistakes. Smarter people learn from other people’s mistakes. Here is something I shared this morning at Seismic after watching some of our men doing burpees.

F3 has been one of the best things that’s ever happened to me. This week I celebrate my five year anniversary with this crazy organization. However, while putting me in the best shape of my life, F3 has also banged me up a lot and I’m now suffering the consequences and I’m paying a lot of money and spending a lot of time correcting my mistakes.

We’re all a bunch of competitive dicks. We want to finish before everyone. We want to lift more and do more push ups. As a result, we are completely ignoring form and slinging cinder blocks around like we're in our twenties.

During IRONMAN training, I noticed that some weeks I was putting in more time than both Speedo and Ma Bell yet they were spending more time running, biking and swimming. It’s because I was having to spend nearly an hour a day stretching while also paying for yoga, a chiropractor and massage therapy.

My back was so tight that I couldn’t lift my arms straight over my head to get flat in the water. I was (and still am) having continuous lower back pain. The bike portion of IRONMAN took me 90 minutes longer than expected because I kept having back spasms and I had to get off the bike every 15 minutes to stretch.

I had to spend most of the year running at a 12 minute pace because I couldn’t keep my heart rate below 170. I joined F3 and wanted to keep up with everyone so, I just ran as fast as I could for four years. I never spent the time to build my aerobic base. Now, I’m having heart palpitations and have to see a cardiologist.

I say all of this because I see a lot of you crazy assholes doing the same thing and I want you to do better than me.

A few points of advice from a man who has made a lot of mistakes:

<strong>1. SLOW DOWN.</strong> When running for the first time, really start off slow for the first few weeks and build that aerobic base. Lots and lots of zone 2 and 3 training. Buy a heart monitor and use it. You will be able to hold faster speeds by running slower in the beginning.

<strong>2. FORM IS EVERYTHING.</strong> 10 pushups with correct form is better than 30 with shitty form. The same goes for sit-ups, burpees and every single thing involving weight. Please do not fuck up your back as I have.

<strong>3. STRETCH.</strong> This is so super important as we get older. Spend 15 minutes a day just stretching or even better, join a yoga class. Trust me, you don’t want to feel like the Tin Man. It sucks and it’s super expensive and time consuming to fix once you’re as bad off as me.

<strong>4. BE COMPETITIVE WITH YOURSELF.</strong> It doesn’t matter how fast the big swinging dick next to you is running or how much weight he is lifting. All that matters is that you are better than you were yesterday.

<strong>5. LEARN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY.</strong> You don’t need a masters degree but you should learn the basics of how your body works. I didn’t do that before jumping into all this madness. I am now and it’s helping me make smarter decisions and helping me stay injury free.

Please don’t be me. Be better.

Your homie,

If all your friends jump off a cliff, would you jump too?

Yes, I would. Because my friends and I are always doing crazy things and making each other stronger.

I just woke up to a text from my friend Chris - “How are you feeling today? Did you get sleep last night? Alcohol?”

Two hours later I received a text from Frankie with a screenshot of his 18 mile run - “it was painful but it’s done son.”

Chris was holding me accountable. Frankie was holding himself accountable by letting me hold him accountable.

You are capable of more than you think you are. What may seem impossible is much easier when you surround yourself with like-minded people, who will hold you accountable and in return, who you also hold accountable.

My Endurance Farm tribe holds me accountable. My F3 brothers and the four horsemen hold me accountable. My church group, my Push Digital leadership team, my forum group all hold me accountable. My wife holds me accountable. All of them for different focuses in my life. In return, I hold all of them accountable. We make each other better.

7051,"Getting Rid Of The Negative People Around You","<h3>One of the hardest things I’ve written.</h3>
Earlier this week, I wrote about accountability circles - surrounding yourself with like-minded people, who will push you to do great things. Today, I must write about the opposite because it’s just as important. This is much harder. It can cause you a lot of short-term pain and even produce a lot of drama. But it must happen for long term success. You must shed the people who are dragging you down.

I’m going to tell you something very painful, perhaps the hardest thing I’ve ever written or said out loud. It keeps me up at night. Some may even call it completely selfish.
<h4>Here it is - I probably could have saved my mother’s life.</h4>
The complete story is one that will have to be written in my book, if I ever get around to it. We don’t have enough time here for one blog post. The summary is that my family was nothing and has never been anything but complete drama. 100% positivity sucking, life draining, success haltering, failure inducing, sometimes ghetto sometimes redneck, absolute drama. My family would make for an amazing reality television show.

I decided around 16-years-old that there was only one escape and it meant leaving it all behind. I had to shed everyone from my life. I had to communicate with them as little as possible and see them even less. I had to disappear and start over. No strings attached. Even one tiny loose string could easily reel me back in to exactly what they were and exactly what I didn’t want to be. Screaming, fighting, boundless and nonstop drama. In fact, it almost did reel me back in. That’s a story for another time.

To this day I catch a lot of hell from my family members wondering why I neglect them. I refuse to look back, especially now that my mother, father and step-father have all passed away.

My mother took her own life in what was labeled an “accidental overdose” on opioids. We all saw the train heading down that particular track. The first time Elizabeth met my mother she, my mother (not Elizabeth), could barely speak because she was so drugged up. Mom was in and out of rehab centers. Every single one of us knew what was coming. Yet, I did nothing. What could I do? The only answer would have been to stop everything I was doing, take care of her full-time and be sucked into a soap opera that would ruin my life.

Now here’s the part that makes me tear up every time I think about it, including right now. After my Mom passed away I found a note written to me asking me to do just that. She wrote me a note saying that I was the only person who could save her but she never passed that note on to me. Maybe she knew. Maybe she knew that her asking and me accepting was me giving up my future. Maybe she loved me enough not to ask. That’s what I like to believe anyway.

My mother was the most loving person I have ever met in my life. She would do anything for anyone. But it came with being sucked into her orbit and that meant a life of negativity. That was something I could not accept. And I would make the same decision today.

<strong>Getting away from negativity is hard</strong>, especially when it’s your parents. <strong>But it must be done.</strong> You need to be surrounded with amazing people who will build you up. You need to get away from everyone tearing you down, including parents, friends, co-workers and maybe even spouses and children. I know with everything that I am that I would not have anything I have today if I would have allowed myself to stay surrounded my family. It hurt. It still hurts. But today I have a life full of phenomenal people and amazing accomplishments. It all started with shedding the negative people.",,2018-11-02,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/getting-rid-of-the-negative-people-around-you/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/181030_Wesley_NoNegative_964x482.png,181030_Wesley_NoNegative_964x482,,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/181030_Wesley_NoNegative_964x482.png,,Blog,"negativity|positive vibes|positivity",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,getting-rid-of-the-negative-people-around-you,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-11-02
7055,"The Nation Is Homogenous And There’s No Going Back","<h3>It’s time to get over it.</h3>
This past weekend my wife and I attended a parenting retreat hosted by Christian psychologist John Rosemond. Overall, the two days we spent with Dr. Rosemond were well worth the time and money. We learned many techniques that we immediately started using with our two boys. I strongly recommend you checking out his books.

Much of Dr. Rosemond’s methodology is based on the idea that we should go back to a 1950s parenting style, where parents were seen as the authority and not the friend. He believes most of what now ails America stems from a shift in parenting styles starting in the 1960s with the concept of relativism - what Google defines as the doctrine that knowledge, truth, and morality exist in relation to culture, society, or historical context, and are not absolute.

In 2018 one’s feelings define reality, which is a major problem because feelings are subjective. That’s why we have to go back to a methodology based on a 1950s parent/child relationship structure, which will spill over into the entire culture. From a political standpoint, some may say that this is what’s truly meant by “Make America Great Again.” Rosemond argued, “we can’t have a nation without a set of common goals among the citizenry and all we have right now are self centered goals based on feelings.”

Now, I agree with Dr. Rosemond. As I argued in my tedX talk (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCKwcbfniUw"">click here to view</a>), technology is doing great things for America, but it is also doing detrimental things to America. The same is true for the home and culture as a whole.

The 1960s ushered in a new era of technology with the proliferation of the television, including the first war being shown in people’s living rooms. New ideas and knowledge began spreading across America like wildfire and as a result, the barriers between neighborhoods, towns, states and regions began dissolving. Small town America died and we started becoming one homogenous nation. It took awhile, but you see it today. There truly isn’t a huge difference between Charleston, South Carolina and Los Angelas, California except for the number of Lamborghinis in LA.

Knowledge is power, or so they say. Unfortunately, humans seem to care more about using that knowledge for fighting than they do building great things and fixing the world’s problems. We’re more divisive than we have ever been as we saw recently with a shooting at a synagogue, a shooting at a yoga studio and a right-wing nutjob sending pipe bombs to liberals he doesn’t like.

We can’t go back to at 1950s home because the home isn’t isolated. The parents and the children must leave the home and become part of a larger culture, where they will inevitably be bombarded with more information and the most differing opinions the world has ever seen. There is absolutely no getting away from it, unless you move your family to the woods and live like the unabomber. There is just no way to revert back to the way it was. And, if we could just start using this knowledge for the betterment of the world, I would argue we shouldn't. I fear that won’t happen in our lifetimes.

So, maybe Dr Rosemond is right. Our children would be better off and we could make America great again if we reverted back to a 1950s home operation. I certainly agree with some of his techniques. But the genie is already out of the bottle and it can’t be put back in. Knowledge through technological changes will only take us further and further away from small-town America.

Check back tomorrow, when I’ll dive deeper into Dr Rosemond’s recommendation about technology.",,2018-11-05,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/the-nation-is-homogenous-and-theres-no-going-back/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/181101_Wesley_HomogenousNation_964x482.png,181101_Wesley_HomogenousNation_964x482,,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/181101_Wesley_HomogenousNation_964x482.png,,Blog,"lifestyle|make america great again|parenting",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,the-nation-is-homogenous-and-theres-no-going-back,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-11-05
7060,"Am I Still A Republican?","<h3>Analyzing my beliefs on Election Day.</h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As I grow older, gain more experience, see more of the world, grow my family, build my businesses and become more open-minded, I find that I am becoming increasingly more frustrated with the party that used to define my beliefs. I use the word “define” purposefully because I used to allow others to tell me what I should think. No more! I’m angry with a party that refuses to hold true to conservative philosophies and is more interested in winning by spreading hate and pitting us against one another. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Today, I’m voting based on what I personally believe and not on what some talk show host tells me I should do.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here is what I believe...</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I believe government is supposed to consist of men coming together to provide the services for the common good that individuals cannot provide for themselves - and nothing else. We should not be shy about investing in those core functions; national security, public safety, and infrastructure, among others.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I believe that one of those core functions is education, and that our education system is totally failing and not even attempting to teach kids fundamental lessons they need to operate in the real world.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I believe that the welfare state is ruining not just the country, but also individuals. We are losing our work ethic and becoming too reliant on the nanny state.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I believe that I have never met a transgender person, but I have met thousands of people in poverty. I believe we should start concentrating on the issues that really matter.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I believe in the ‘United States of America,’ and that people have forgotten those first two words - United States. Power is supposed to come from the states, but the federal government has stolen too much power and grown well beyond what our founders intended.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I believe high taxes, growing bureaucracy and unneeded red tape at all levels of government are stopping entrepreneurs from growing businesses and creating more jobs.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I believe that both parties include good, honest people, and both include corrupt people. No political party has the monopoly on ethics or morality.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I believe that even the most well-intentioned politicians get wrapped up in a system controlled by special interests, and eventually, too many elected officials put those special interests above the needs of the people.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I believe that world history has proven that only strength works on the international stage. Thus, we must ensure our military is the strongest on the planet.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I believe that our immigration system needs a complete overhaul and the problem won’t be fixed with a piecemealed approach. People should come into this nation through legal means, but we must start talking about those people like they are human beings and approach them with the love commanded by God.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I believe that no one except God knows when a human becomes a human, and because of that, we should err on the side of caution and assume a human is created at conception.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I believe a woman has the right to do with her body as she pleases, except in the case of ending another human’s life.</span>

7067,"Technology Is Changing The Way We See Ourselves","There's an app for everything - from tracking your daily caloric intake to finding the best new restaurants and bars around you to monitoring your sleeping patterns, you can find an app for all of it.

But, how is this influx in technology changing the way we see ourselves?

With the creation of filters and photoshopping apps, technology has created unrealistic expectations of reality.

Just look at some of the most popular social media apps such as Instagram and Snapchat. They've capitalized on their ability to alter one's physical appearance through filters.

People are becoming increasingly obsessed with what they look like. They fantasize over looking the way they do in their excessively photoshopped and filtered photos.

Plastic surgeons have gone so far as to classify this epidemic as ""Snapchat dysmorphia.""

<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/08/06/patients-are-desperate-to-resemble-their-doctored-selfies-plastic-surgeons-alarmed-by-snapchat-dysmorphia/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.ce26ea1eca49"">An article</a> by <em>The Washington Post </em>recently highlighted this phenomenon, explaining the concern from plastic surgeons, who have seen a rise in patients requesting to look like their filtered self.

Essentially, technology has created unattainable standards of beauty that have caused people to obsess over their appearance.

7075,"We Are Already Cyborgs","<h3>Let’s prepare our children for the inevitable future.</h3>
“Tell your kids they can have a phone under two conditions. First, they pay for it themselves. Second, they have moved out the house.” That’s the advice Christian psychologist and parenting expert John Rosemond gave to us last week at a two-day parenting conference. As I wrote in a <a href=""https://wesleydonehue.com/the-nation-is-homogenous-and-theres-no-going-back/"">previous post</a>, I agreed with the large majority of Dr. Rosemond’s suggestions. There are a few I took exception with, especially this one.

Last week, I noticed I was getting low on toothpaste. Toothbrush in one hand and phone in the other, I opened up my Amazon app and ordered toothpaste with one click. It showed up at my door two days later.

Yesterday, I ordered and paid for my coffee before arriving to Starbucks with my app. A few hours later, I checked in to the gym with an app. I tracked my workout with an app.

Today, I used my Delta app to get through TSA and to board two flights. I used a Hilton app to open the door to my hotel room.

None of this includes the hours I spent with my phone getting actual work done and making money. It doesn’t include the hours I consume news or watch the stock market. It doesn’t include all the time using my phone to communicate with other humans.

I have cameras in my children’s rooms and watch the feeds on my phone. I control the thermostat to my house with my phone. I unlock the door to my home with my phone.

These are all super cool options in 2018. I don’t believe they will stay options in the future. I believe that’s the primary way it will be a decade from now. The phone will be the primary tool to do everything I just mentioned. Look no further than McDonald’s who is eliminating cashiers and making it mandatory to use electronic devices to order food.

Let’s go back to my Amazon toothpaste example. Amazon is already testing out self-driving trucks and delivery drones. They already have robots in the warehouses. A decade from, this is how it’s going to look:

You will order products on your phone.

Those products will be delivered to a warehouse by a self-driving truck.

A robot will retrieve the product from the shelf and pass it off to a drone.

A drone will fly to your doorstep and drop off the product shortly after you’ve ordered it.

This isn’t science fiction. We’re more than halfway there already. Which leads me to my point: Rosemond says we shouldn’t give phones to our children. I say that in doing so, they will be completely unprepared for a world where everything is controlled by phones and technology. They won’t be able to buy toothpaste. They won’t be able to open a locked door, change the thermostat, control the television, or even turn on an oven. Furthermore, I don’t even see how they will be able to make it through their teenage years without a phone. Hell, their first car will most likely be a phone too, or in some part controlled by one.

In a recent podcast, Joe Rogan asked Elon Musk when the majority of humans will become cyborgs. He responded, “we already are.” His point is that we all have phones attached to us. All knowledge from the beginning of human history is sitting in our hands. The only thing that will change is the connection between the device and our minds and the speed at which the brain will access the knowledge.

So, be good parents. Yes, there are plenty of hazards in them having access to all content ever created or being able to chat with their homies all day. But this world isn’t going backwards and technology is no longer just creeping into our lives. It’s controlling everything we do. Your kids need to be prepared for the world in which they will be released.",,2018-11-08,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/we-are-already-cyborgs/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/181107_Wesley_Cyborgs_964x482.png,181107_Wesley_Cyborgs_964x482,,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/181107_Wesley_Cyborgs_964x482.png,,Blog,"digital age|digital marketing",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,we-are-already-cyborgs,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-11-08

7084,"Technology Is Consuming All Of Our Attention","It's no secret that we're all glued to technology.

The majority of our interactions with others come through some form of technology - a cell phone, computer, tablet, etc.

We're addicted to it.

Our attention is no longer on the people and places were surrounded by, it's now on how many likes our last photo got.

While it may seem as though liking an Instagram photo or sending a Snapchat or updating your status on Facebook is a ""social interaction,"" it's not.

We're no longer living in the moment.

Instead, we've become completely consumed by technology and in turn, are much less likely to engage in person-to-person interactions.

Researchers have even suggested <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2017/12/11/phone-addiction-is-real-and-so-are-its-mental-health-risks/#77c3da3413df"">a link</a> between the rise in mental health problems with the amount of screen time individuals have on a daily basis. Much of this screen time is spent on social media, outlets that only serve to show the highlights of a person's life and thus contribute to unrealistic comparisons and expectations of one's own life.

So, not only is technology pulling us further away from the people we love, it's also pulling us away from reality.

To combat this, we have to <strong>stop</strong> socializing purely through technology and start socializing in-person again.

Apple recently introduced a new screen-time feature, highlighting how many hours a day you spend on your phone - going so far as to specify the exact type of content you were looking at.

<img class=""wp-image-7096 size-medium aligncenter"" src=""https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_5910-234x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""234"" height=""300"" />

It's certainly a step in the right direction. But, in reality how many people are going to actually change their viewing habits based on this report? Probably not a lot.

We each have to make a concerted effort to be present with one another and not with technology.

7109,"Two Marathons In Six Days","<h3>My next crazy challenge.</h3>
All year I’ve been planning to run the Kiawah Island Marathon on Saturday, December 6th. In fact, I’m training to PR.

A couple months ago, Elizabeth signed up for a calligraphy class in Palm Beach, Florida during the weekend of November 30th, which just so happens to be my 39th birthday. After registering for the class and booking our rooms, Elizabeth called me and said “so, there’s a half and full marathon the same weekend and it pretty much starts and ends at our hotel. The races are December 1st. Do you want to sign up for the half?”

“Hell No,” I replied. “Sign me up for the full!”

Of course she replied, “you know you have the Kiawah Marathon six days later, right?”

“Have you even met me?” I asked.

Why run two marathons in six days? Because it friggin sucks. That’s why. Because it hurts like hell. Because it’s exhausting.

Because doing things that suck, hurt like hell and are exhausting make me a stronger person. Because doing the harder thing prepares me for most other challenges that come my way. It strengthens me mentally. It makes me a hard son of a bitch ready to tackle the world.

All the endurance insanity has it’s physical benefits but it’s far more mentally and emotionally beneficial. Doing shit that sucks teaches you how to set a goal and to tackle that goal no matter what bullshit gets in the way and no matter how painful it is. Sitting on the couch doesn’t teach you that. At some point when you get used to it even running one marathon doesn’t teach you that. I want the constant lessons. I want to always be learning.

Yes I want to get stronger and faster. But, I’ll never be the strongest and fastest. I won’t even be in the top 25% - but damn if I can’t sneak my way into the top 10% of mentally tough people. That’s my goal, y’all!

So, when Elizabeth asked me again last night, “are you sure you don’t want to just do the half,” my answer is still a resounding HELL NO! I’m doing the harder thing.",,2018-11-19,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/two-marathons-in-six-days/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/181119_Wesley_DoTheHarderThing_964x482.png,181119_Wesley_DoTheHarderThing_964x482,,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/181119_Wesley_DoTheHarderThing_964x482.png,,Blog,"endurance|goal setting|goals|marathons|push harder|push yourself",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,two-marathons-in-six-days,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-11-19
7113,"2018 Has Been The Most Difficult Year Yet","<h3>And, I’m Thankful For It.</h3>
Yesterday, I wrote “doing shit that sucks teaches you how to set a goal and to tackle that goal no matter what bullshit gets in the way and no matter how painful it is.” That pretty much sums up the state of Push Digital in November of 2018.

We stormed into 2018 stronger than ever and with a forecast far exceeding every other year. The economy was soaring, we were entering an election year and our stable was full of large corporate clients. Then the bottom fell out during the first two weeks of the year when we lost three of our largest corporate clients due to staff restructuring.

There was nothing we could do about it. We did nothing wrong. It wasn’t our fault. Our work was awesome. In one case, our work literally saved the client from going under. But, heads rolled at the top of the corporate ladder and those heads belonged to our friends. After all, we work in corporate crisis and in crisis, we can’t expect stability. That was a hard lesson learned.

As a result we had our first company layoff. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my career. I cried. I stress puked. I entered a state of depression.

I let myself do that for about a week before taking a page from my endurance training. I told myself to suck it up, buttercup. Embrace the suck. Build a plan, follow the plan and cross the finish line. That’s what I did.

We restructured the team and promoted new leaders. We built a new office infrastructure with a strong COO. We rebuilt our finance system. We redesigned our entire creative process. We hired a business development director and built a new sales system. We changed my role with the company.

Today, we are back up to the number of staff we had before the layoff with the most talented staff we’ve ever had. We have huge new clients. Those clients are diversified across campaign, advocacy and corporate verticals to blunt any future decline. Revenue is back to where it was. But most important, the infrastructure and processes of the company are stronger than ever and rebuilt to scale the company for growth. That wouldn’t have happened without the hard times. The hard year forced me to rebuild the foundation of the company and now it’s stronger than ever.

So, as we approach Thanksgiving, I’m thankful for the hard year. We’re much stronger for it.",,2018-11-20,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/2018-has-been-the-most-difficult-year-yet/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/181119_Wesley_ThankfulForHardTimes_964x482.png,181119_Wesley_ThankfulForHardTimes_964x482,,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/181119_Wesley_ThankfulForHardTimes_964x482.png,,Blog,"corporate crisis|crisis|goals|push digital",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,2018-has-been-the-most-difficult-year-yet,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-11-20
7121,"The Hard Truth About Entrepreneurship","Yesterday was National Entrepreneurs Day.

I had this blog post planned but the day got away from me as I was busy, you know...being an entrepreneur.

Entrepreneurship is having its moment in the sun. It’s the new trendy profession. I think it has a lot to do with Shark Tank or everyone thinking they have the idea for the next Facebook, Amazon or Google. Entrepreneurs are the new rockstars.

If you look at the magazine covers, you would think this is a pretty stress-free baller lifestyle. If you watch the YouTube videos of those 20-year-olds with their luxury homes and Lamborghinis, you would think this is a glamorous lifestyle.

I’m here to set the record straight. Yes, those kind of folks do exist. However, the people featured on the covers of <em>Inc.</em>, <em>Entrepreneur</em> and <em>Fast Company</em> magazines are unicorns. They’re rare. They don’t represent the 99.9% of entrepreneurs out there. As for those twenty-year-olds on YouTube, they are all completely full of shit. #FakeNews

Now, I’m not whining here. I love the flexibility of being able to do what I want, when I want. I love building. I love the chase. I love winning. This is the life I’ve chosen and I wouldn’t have it any other way. But damn y’all... this is the farthest thing from a baller or glamorous lifestyle.
<h4>Let me be the guy who tells you what it’s like before you jump in this game.</h4>
It’s nothing but stress. Total stress. All the time. Never-ending ulcer inducing stress.

It’s about hard work - not fancy cars, boats, vacations and chillin'. It’s ball busting, nose to the grindstone, 80 hours a week work. Your head never leaves the office. Never!

It’s trying to make everyone happy while making no one happy.

It’s constant bitching. Everyone's fighting all the time and I have to be the referee and sometimes the only adult in the room.

It’s about spreadsheets. Sooooo many spreadsheets and financial reports. And, they aren’t being viewed on a laptop on a Caribbean beach.

It’s about staying up all night and sometimes even puking because payroll is coming.

It’s about making decisions that impact families - not just your family. Husbands, wives and children that aren’t yours rely on the income you produce.

It’s about people’s lives - their futures, their security, even their safety - all on you.

It doesn’t stop just because some expert came up with the theory of work/life balance. Total horse shit! It doesn’t exist.

It’s about decisions. All day. Non-stop. Hundreds of decisions every day. All of them demanding immediacy.

It’s about no one else understanding. No one within the company sees the big picture. No one outside understands why you are the way you are.

It’s everyone thinking you’re rich. They look at you different. They talk about you behind your back. They ask for things. None of them understand that you’re succeeding because the money is reinvested back into the operation.

It’s lonely. Perhaps one of the most lonely professions in the world.

This game isn’t made for everyone. It’s made for rock-hard people, who can hold the world on their shoulders. If you can do that, then jump on in. But, don’t jump in just because the lifestyle looks cool in a staged YouTube video.",,2018-11-21,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/the-hard-truth-about-entrepreneurship/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/181120_Wesley_Entreprenuership_964x482.png,181120_Wesley_Entreprenuership_964x482,,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/181120_Wesley_Entreprenuership_964x482.png,,Blog,"careers|Entrepreneurs|Entrepreneurship|National Entrepreneurs Day.|professions",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,the-hard-truth-about-entrepreneurship,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-11-21

7133,"Help Me Spread POSITIVE VIBES Across The Internet","Folks, let’s be real for a minute. I’m guilty. You’re guilty. We are all spreading negativity around the Internet and putting each other in horrible moods. Everything around us is doom and gloom. The world is going to hell in a handbasket. We’re all just bitching and yelling at each other.

The facts are much different. If you’re reading this post, you probably aren’t part of the world’s population living under a violent dictatorial regime. You probably aren’t starving. You probably aren’t in a village ravaged by disease. You probably aren’t fleeing your country and walking thousands of miles to another country that doesn’t want you.

Sure, you might be having a rough go at it, but in the grand scheme of things, compared to much of the world’s population or pretty much everyone who has ever lived on this planet, you have it pretty damn good.

You live in a country that gives you free education and equal opportunity. You have access to some sort of healthcare. You probably have a roof over your head, a temperature controlled home and food in your stomach.

And yes, some have it better than others. Injustice does exist. We are all born into different circumstances. But really, we all have it pretty damn awesome. We hit the jackpot. We were born in America.

Over the past few weeks, you’ve probably noticed a shift in my content. I’m posting a lot of the same images and messages each day. I’m posting more motivational content. Yes, I know it’s repetitive and even cheesy. But I don’t care because I have one goal - cover up some of y’all’s negative bullshit with <strong>POSITIVITY!</strong>

So, here’s my simple request - will you join me for the remainder of 2018? Just one month. That’s it.

Don’t whine and complain. Don’t post sob stories to make people feel bad for you. Don’t share negative stories. Don’t bitch about politics. Don’t get into online arguments.

To put it simply, they both have their challenges and successes.

For example, you have to have a strategy for both. You can't approach a marathon without a plan. You have to train weeks in advance, map out the course itself, determine your pace for each individual mile and suck up the pain when things get tough.

Similarly, when you're running a business, you can't go in blindly. You have to have a plan for how you're going to meet your goals. You have to surround yourself with people you trust to execute those goals, constantly monitor your numbers, and fake the positive vibes when shit hits the fan.

7160,"How Push Digital Helped Make SC Roads Safer","[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oJpkZHCIXg[/embed]

South Carolina has some of the worst roads and bridges in the nation. The state is often the leader in the number of highway fatalities. It has the 4th largest highway system in the country and the 3rd lowest gas tax in which to fund repairs and upkeep. For decades, the South Carolina General Assembly has refused to either raise the gas tax or reform how the state’s Department of Transportation is funded.

Push Digital played a vital role in helping South Carolina enact it's first significant roads funding measure in 30 years.

Push Digital began by analyzing the existing message and throwing it away. The message before our involvement had focused on money only. It had failed. We developed a strategic message aimed at building people’s personal opinions about the condition of roads and bridges. We then developed a digital strategy that would allow them the chance to voice that opinion to others including their elected officials.
<h3>The message was:
SC roads are (you tell us!)</h3>
The biggest challenge we faced was raising a tax in Conservative South Carolina.

We chose a digital advocacy campaign specifically because of the growing segment of users aged 35 and up using the Internet for news, the speed at which information could be disseminated to the audience and the ability to quickly convert the audience into activists. We set an objective to build an online grassroots coalition that would contact legislators, garner news media coverage from traditional outlets and ultimately win public support from legislators and the Governor. We measured that objective against daily online metrics, the number of news articles generated, contacts from supporters to legislators and ultimately statements from elected officials.

We built a unique website with a strong call-to-action. It encouraged people to give us their opinion, submit images and video of roads conditions near them and to take action by contacting legislators.

The advocacy campaign did not end when lawmakers left town. During the three-year long campaign, South Carolina went through two election cycles. This presented an opportunity to further engage with voters and garner the attention of lawmakers. We provided voters with the tools to communicate with the candidates for Governor in 2014 and actively informed voters where their representatives stood on the issue in 2016.

The legislative process is notoriously slow. As the funding plans progressed through the SC House and then bogged down in the SC Senate, the campaign’s message evolved.
<h4>From South Carolina’s bad roads are costing you money in repairs to South Carolina’s bad roads are costing lives.</h4>
The political environment also affected the message development. As the grassroots’ pressure increased, more emphasis was placed on Republican lawmakers - telling them fixing South Carolina’s roads was the responsible investment to make.

Perseverance and patience lead to success - enacting the first significant roads funding measure in 30 years. In three years, we moved an issue that was a low priority for voters in polling to the number one issue on voters’ mind. The issue went from an afterthought in the General Assembly to a must-pass bill. In addition to passing a plan that will have a positive impact for South Carolina for generations to come, we hammered tidal waves of grassroots support, news interest and demonstrated the <strong>power and effectiveness of digital advocacy</strong> in the South Carolina Statehouse.",,2018-12-17,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/how-push-digital-helped-make-sc-roads-safer/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/0002992c-f3ff-11e8-8406-7e509ab9d3a6.png|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/150217_FixSCRoads_FixThemselvesTW.jpg|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/96b9756c-bcea-11e8-ab49-a0369f35eeca.png|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2017-02-07-at-4.33.19-PM.png|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/b4c7ea52-bfde-11e7-97e8-008cfa0082e9.png|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a5ed21b6-d2e1-11e8-a13b-1af1a79c3f9e.jpeg|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/5dd640b0-f253-11e8-9aa2-d287762cc111.png|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a332a234-d2e1-11e8-ad59-d204d8534193-2.png|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/36672b24-d5e5-11e7-8f05-008cfa0082e9-2.png|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/170601_SCFixOurRoads_Hero.jpg,"0002992c-f3ff-11e8-8406-7e509ab9d3a6|150217_FixSCRoads_FixThemselvesTW|96b9756c-bcea-11e8-ab49-a0369f35eeca|Screen Shot 2017-02-07 at 4.33.19 PM|b4c7ea52-bfde-11e7-97e8-008cfa0082e9|a5ed21b6-d2e1-11e8-a13b-1af1a79c3f9e|5dd640b0-f253-11e8-9aa2-d287762cc111|a332a234-d2e1-11e8-ad59-d204d8534193-2|36672b24-d5e5-11e7-8f05-008cfa0082e9-2|170601_SCFixOurRoads_Hero",|||||||||,|||||||||,|||||||||,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/0002992c-f3ff-11e8-8406-7e509ab9d3a6.png,,Blog,"advocacy|digital advocacy|digital marketing|funding|infrastructure|Politics|roads|roads funding|sc politics|sc roads|south carolina",publish,2,PDAdmin,dev@pushdigital.com,Push,Admin,how-push-digital-helped-make-sc-roads-safer,,,0,0,0,open,open,2018-12-17
7172,"The End Is The Beginning","<h3>My 2019 Fitness Goals.</h3>
On Saturday I crossed the finish line of the Kiawah Marathon. It was the end of one race, the end of my 2018 race schedule but most importantly, it was the end of Phase 1 of my endurance journey.
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

I wasn’t athletic growing up. I didn’t play organized sports. I certainly didn’t run. A few years ago, I didn’t feel well and I went to a doctor, who said my blood pressure was sky high from stress. He gave me three options: find a less stressful job, take medication or start working out. I started hitting the gym, but it didn’t stick. Then, Edwin Peacock introduced me to F3 and my life changed forever. I was hooked.

I could write for days about how I got to where I am today. I’ll summarize it instead by just saying that I’ve gone as hard as I could at the detriment of my body. I wanted to keep up with all my F3 brothers.
<h3>I wanted to lead from the front.</h3>
This was the craziest year so far. Over 700 hours of training. Over 1000 miles running. Over 3,000 miles between biking, swimming and running. 5 marathons. Ironman. And so much more.

My body is crushed. My back and hips are a train wreck. I’ve been having heart problems that the cardiologist can’t figure out. The truth is that I haven’t ever listened to my body. I waited too long to educate myself on biology and physiology. I didn’t train smart. I just went hard until I collapsed.

(A quick bit of advice: don’t be like me. Be smarter. Don’t wreck your body in some obsessive attempt to be a badass. Go hard. Be a badass. But, be a badass that can do badassery for decades.)

Now, it’s time to start over. Completely. From scratch. I’m entering Phase 2 of my fitness journey.

In 2019 you will see a different Wesley. Now that I am an Ironman it’s time to become a <em>fast</em> Ironman. The target is IM TX in April 2020. That means I must spend the next year rebuilding my body the right way. I’m slowing way down. And that means far fewer events in 2019.

I publish my goals publicly because so many of you hold me accountable, especially my F3 brothers. So, as we close 2018 I give you my 2019 fitness goals:
<h4>1. Train smart to crush IM TX, April 26 2020
2. 2 half Ironman distance triathlons
3. 1 major American marathon (NYC, DC or Chicago)
4. 3 sprints triathlons
5. Lowcountry Splash
6. Get a shredded core
7. Get super flexible</h4>
Thank you for inspiring me to be a healthier person and for all of your support along the way.

7182,"Color Me Red - Branding & Color","Think about the most recognizable brands that use the color red in their branding. Your mind may have immediately thought of brands like Coca-Cola or Netflix or ESPN.

These are easily identifiable brands for a variety of reasons - tasty soda, a binge-watching haven, and around-the-clock sports coverage. But, they've also capitalized on the use of the color RED in their respective logos.

Red is a strong color that can evoke a wide-range of emotions from consumers.

Some brands get it right, others fall short.

7257,"2019 - The Year Of We","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I began reviewing all my posts from 2018 with the goal of publishing a “Best of 2018” post. I immediately realized how embarrassed and disappointed in myself I am.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For starters, it wasn’t honest. 2018 was by far the hardest year I’ve ever had professionally. Push suffered a lot. It was a real struggle. All the while I put on this fake smile and acted like we were crushing it every day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what really disappointed me was how self centered my content was. I fell into the social media “look at me, look at me” trap. And no offense, you’re in that trap too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Look at me crushing entrepreneurship.&nbsp;<br>Look at me traveling to cool places.&nbsp;<br>Look at me crossing another finish line.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aren’t I awesome?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I read my posts and thought “shut the hell up, douchebag.” That’s why I went so dark the last three weeks of the year. I didn’t like myself very much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Internet is 98% fake ass bullshit of people pretending to be something they’re not. Please don’t get mad at me. You keep doing you. If “fake it till you make it” is your motto, then by all means, keep on keeping on. That’s the world we live in but that’s just not me. Maybe it used to be. That’s not the 39 year old beat up Wesley, who now has what feels like five lifetimes of experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m going to keep publishing daily content with the goal of putting out more content in 2019 than I’ve ever published. The biggest difference is that I’m not going to be focused on ME.<strong> I’m going to be focused on you.</strong> On us. We’re a team. There will be a whole lot less “I” and a whole lot more “we.” 2018 was the year of Positive Vibes. <strong>2019 is the year of WE.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have one big rule - if my content doesn’t help someone else get better, it doesn’t go out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No more “look at me” bullshit. It’s about how we can get better together.</p>

7263,"A Two-Part Marketing Strategy In A Self-Centered World","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether you’re marketing your service or product, solving a PR crisis, or running for public office, this is the single most important piece of advice I can give you: <strong>It isn’t all about you!</strong><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are in the age of <strong>“look at me.”</strong> Self-centeredness abounds on every social media platform we interact with. Everyone’s life goal is to “be happy.” That may seem fine at first, but it's a vast departure from America’s past, where a person’s goal wasn’t to be in it for oneself - it was to be in it for the community as a whole. Happiness leads to short- sighted, self-centered decision-making, rather than the long-term planning that benefits everyone. Still, that’s where we are today, and that impacts how we must market.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My advice may seem contradictory in a time when we elected Donald Trump - a man who is constantly telling us how great he is - as President of the United States. However, it’s important to understand that that’s not all Donald Trump says. In his self- centeredness (unlike Kanye West’s), President Trump tells us how his greatness can help us personally. He is the man who can keep our families safe. He is the only man who can build our economy, and thus our personal wealth. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donald Trump is perhaps the <strong>greatest marketer and media manipulator of our generation.</strong><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, I’m not saying to follow his lead. He offends as much as he attracts. That does work at times in politics, but not so much in issue advocacy and corporate brand reputation. My point is that he has figured out the right formula, and you should follow it. In marketing you must not get caught up in the <strong>“look at me” social media trap</strong>. You must find a Trump-like strategy that says “look at me and look at what I can personally do for you.”<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m a frequent critic of the President’s communications, but the man just gets it. The “look at me” aspect is what most marketers concentrate on, but it’s just the first part of a two-part strategy. It’s the foundation. The <strong>“look at what I can do for you”</strong> part is irrelevant without first winning the argument that you are indeed the person or organization with the best experience, qualifications, knowledge and work ethic to get results. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The problem with most current marketing plans is that they don’t concentrate on both sides of the argument, or they don’t connect the two dots. More likely than not, they concentrate too much on part one, because that’s what individual marketing professionals see in their social media feeds. Thus, they think it’s a trend they should jump on. &nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many marketers think people just want to see more selfies instead of realizing that selfies are everywhere because <strong>people want the attention. </strong>They have become too self-centered. Therefore, they don’t want your selfie. They want to know what’s in it for them. The attention needs to be placed on them. That’s what they crave most. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We acknowledge the <strong>two-part formula</strong> and implemented it well in <strong>SeaWorld’s ‘Park To Planet’</strong> campaign. Step one proved that SeaWorld was the most qualified organization to save the world’s oceans. Step two showed how the individual can have a ton of fun getting involved. It wasn’t just about saving the oceans. It was about a day of fun for the family, thus the premise: “We have a whole lot of fun doing it.”<br></p>

7284,"What Is Push Digital?","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wrapping your brain around what a media company does can be difficult. Strategies and technology change constantly. Here’s the core of who we are and what we do to help you better understand how we can help your team!<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""customFontSize"":25} -->
<p style=""font-size:25px""><strong>What is Push Digital?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href=""https://pushdigital.com"">Push Digital </a>is a digital-first integrated media company built to meet the demands of today’s constantly-evolving media landscape.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""customFontSize"":25} -->
<p style=""font-size:25px""><strong>What does that mean?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Television and digital media are on a collision course as people consume more media on mobile devices and Internet-connected televisions. <strong>Soon we will be placing all TV ads the same way digital ads are placed today. We’re the agency positioning you for the future.</strong><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The days of reaching the masses with one broad message are gone—<strong>you can no longer afford to talk to everyone as if they’re the same.</strong> We produce creative for a specific target audience, drive the ads to that audience where they consume information, and then monitor and optimize the advertising every single day.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""customFontSize"":25} -->
<p style=""font-size:25px""><strong>What kind of media do you create?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We think of ourselves as a content factory, creating all forms of digital media in-house from video to long-form written pieces to moving and static images. That’s what we’re the best at. We also create television ads, direct mail and just about every form of marketing materials like signs, billboards and brochures. We’ve even wrapped a few buses. ?<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""customFontSize"":25} -->
<p style=""font-size:25px""><strong>Do you handle the media placement?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>100% YES! Creative and media placement should not and cannot be separated. <strong>Advertising cannot be “set it and forget it.”</strong> We use extensive data analysis to launch many different versions of creative and monitor them every single day to determine what’s working and what’s not. It’s called optimization and it must happen quickly and daily. That’s how you get the biggest bang for your buck and that can’t happen when separate agencies are building and placing creative.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""customFontSize"":25} -->
<p style=""font-size:25px""><strong>How are you different?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone will say they’re creative. Not everyone will say they’re <strong>tough, intense, fast, thrifty, and the hardest-working agency around.</strong> We hustle. We push—that’s the mentality we gained from years of political campaigning.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for our approach, we crank out more content than most other agencies—content built for specific audiences with extensive data analysis. That’s another tactic we learned from political campaigns—one that most agencies aren’t willing to adopt. It’s hard and frankly, it cuts into agency profits. Also, most big agencies aren’t built to be that fast and nimble, but that’s our approach because it’s how marketing must be done in 2019.<br></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""customFontSize"":25} -->
<p style=""font-size:25px""><strong>Push Campaigns</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If recent campaigns have taught us anything, it’s that digital wins political battles. Whether it’s the contentious “Gateway-to-the-South” primary South Carolina is known for, Senatorial and Gubernatorial races, or big committees and SuperPACs, <strong>Push Digital is known for utilizing cutting-edge technologies and proven strategies to win elections.</strong><br></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When your job is to stand up for others, it’s important to know what you stand for yourself. At Push Digital, we believe in a fairer, freer, friendlier (hey, we’re idealistic) world—both online and off. Those values are our compass when integrating with your organization and aligning with your goals. We aren’t afraid to roll up our sleeves and fight hard because, in the end, making a difference is always worth it.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""customFontSize"":25} -->
<p style=""font-size:25px""><strong>Push Brands</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From our view, a brand has two natural states: static or crisis. It’s only with a dynamic team that you can nimbly shift gears and adjust to whatever the market throws your way, without losing equity. At Push Digital, <strong>we’re rewriting the rulebook for what a brand can be and the stories it can tell. </strong>Our focused approach is simple: start a conversation and don’t let it stop. That’s how we unlock your brand’s greatest potential.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""customFontSize"":25} -->
<p style=""font-size:25px""><strong>Push Creative</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every great agency knows how to produce impeccable creative, but our content stands out for its proven track record of changing perceptions, moving products, and positively impacting our clients’ bottom lines. Our in-house team’s capabilities span from branding, design and copywriting to web development and film production. We can build your brand from scratch, grow it, and take it to the next level.<br></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More than 34 million Americans—nearly a 10th of the population—have pulled the plug on cable and become “Cord Cutters.” This group will likely never see a broadcast or cable television advertisement. <strong>Our team seeks to bridge the gap by offering dynamic strategies for both TV and streaming audiences, ensuring your message reaches every intended audience.</strong> Our plans leave no stone unturned, giving your organization a comprehensive view of the audience landscape.<br></p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Relationships are the currency enabling us to get the job done—and building those connections requires us to get off our mobile devices and back to traditional communications and coalition development. Recognizing the conventional lines separating the digital and real world no longer exist, Push Digital has expanded its client focus to the seamless development of co-existing online and offline strategies.</p>

7299,"New SC Organization Promotes Benefits of Medical Cannabis","<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3><em>Poll by Push Digital and WPA Intel shows majority of SC voters support medical cannabis&nbsp;</em></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a new organization in South Carolina promoting the benefits of legalized access to medical cannabis. The <a href=""http://www.sccannabisassociation.org/"">South Carolina Cannabis Association</a> is a recently announced Grassroots coalition of Palmetto State compassionate care advocates, farmers and businesses owners advocating for access to medical marijuana for those who need it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wesley Donehue, South Carolina political consultant and entrepreneur, played a key role in organizing the critical mass of support that led to the formation the South Carolina Cannabis Association. Donehue said, “The compassionate care benefits of cannabis are well documented and the public support for access to medical cannabis in our state is strong. These are facts our elected officials must come to recognize and respond accordingly, as there is no longer any excuse for them to be this out-of-touch with the will of their constituents.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The South Carolina Cannabis Association in conjunction with Push Digital and WPA Intelligence conducted a poll last week that clearly shows widespread support for medical cannabis. The professionally conducted, independent survey of 600 registered voters in South Carolina from January 22-24 found that:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Most South Carolina voters are in favor of medical cannabis</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Six out of ten South Carolina voters (58%) support legislation that expands access to medical cannabis</li><li>This includes a majority or plurality support across all partisan breaks – Majority of Independents (72%), Democrats (65%) and a plurality of Republicans (45%)</li><li>In contrast, just thirteen percent (13%) are opposed while three out of ten (29%) are unsure</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":7302} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donehue continued, “Just a few short years ago, our state’s laws made it nearly impossible to operate a craft brewery in South Carolina. Through a combination of online organization and direct advocacy we convinced lawmakers the benefits of changing those laws and we successfully allowed for the establishment and expansion of this new, positive industry. That is exactly what the South Carolina Cannabis Association plans to do for the compassionate care use of medical marijuana in our state.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>State lawmakers in the House and Senate have introduced legislation establishing access to medical cannabis -&nbsp;<strong>The Compassionate Care Act</strong>(<a href=""https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess123_2019-2020/bills/3660.htm"">H. 3660</a>&amp;&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess123_2019-2020/bills/366.htm"">S. 366</a>). The Senate and House bills create a regulated system through the state’s Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) that will allow doctors to recommend the medical use of cannabis to patients with conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, cancer and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The South Carolina Cannabis Association sets the foundation to protect and promote the use of medical cannabis for compassionate care applications, as well as advocate on behalf of business owners and agricultural opportunities for marijuana in South Carolina. The association’s primary focus will include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>ADVOCACY</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SCCA will serve as a resource to the South Carolina General Assembly to implement a sensible and fair regulatory framework in regards to medical marijuana for compassionate care applications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>ACCESS</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SCCA will advocate on behalf of South Carolinians who need access to medical marijuana to enjoy the same quality of life that we all expect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>AGRICULTURE</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>SCCA will promote South Carolina’s agricultural system and farmers by increasing the number, type and yield of crop options available to South Carolina’s farmers.</p>

<p>I had been working in politics for a while, but I decided to start a digital agency after the first time I went viral.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was back in 2009, President Barack Obama was giving a speech about his healthcare plan to a joint session of Congress, and our very own South Carolina Congressman Joe Wilson captured the nation’s attention. Breaking decorum, Wilson shouted “You lie!” when President Obama discussed the&nbsp;coverage of undocumented immigrants in his plan. It was unreal. The entire country was taken aback, especially those of us who know Joe as one of the most honorable and kind gentlemen you will ever meet.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Look, good or bad, right or wrong, it was a moment. And I found myself back at a bar on Folly Beach, SC all night. We were vacationing at the beach at a house with no wifi. The bar was the only place I could find. I was hyped on everything I had been experimenting with on our social and email channels, and I saw potential that (at that point in time) no one else did.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I blasted out an email that night. I called my friend David All to start activating bloggers. My team spent the entire night keeping the site up because it was being hacked every minute. By the next day we were breaking fundraising records. In the 48 hours following the “You lie!” moment, we spun up, executed, and capitalized on a multi-channel, multi-platform campaign. The results were staggering. Millions of dollars raised with nearly 500,000 email signups.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was my first time going viral. Since then, I founded Push Digital, grew it into a full-service agency, and now lead my staff of nearly 50 in our daily work of earning real results for our customers by leveraging our digital expertise. Sometimes it’s a grind. Sometimes it’s a viral success. But pushing our clients to the next level, those are the moments we strive for.&nbsp;<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’re ready to do it for you. If you’ve been curious about making gains, for your personal brand, your start up, or your organization, I’m inviting you to hit us up. This just might be your moment to go viral.&nbsp;</p>

7328,"You Can't Match My Hustle","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I feel like a political candidate responding to an opponent. It’s weird that I normally suggest my clients do these type of responses and I’m having to do it myself. But, I guess business is a lot like political campaigns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, I’ve been traveling a lot lately trying to slam in all my travel before baby boy number three arrives here shortly. And as I’m out on the road pitching to clients, I’m hearing for the first time that some of my competitors out there that are pitching business against me are saying that, “Wesley no longer pays attention to PUSH - all he does is train for events and drink craft beer.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Damn…that’s a ridiculous statement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Look, I’m productive. I get up at 3:45 in the morning and I’m out the door by 4:30 AM. I’m done with my training before most of my competitors wake up in the morning. I don’t drink a lot of craft beer because of my training. And, I spend maybe 5-10% max of my time on Frothy Beard related activities - it’s connected to the office so, I’m able to just swing over and handle things whenever I want.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, what drives me the craziest is that - I’m out there hustling. It’s 7 o’clock in the morning and I’m at the office.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am up working out for two, sometimes three hours and at the office before my competitors even wake up in the morning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I’m sorry that you guys (my competitors) are lazy as hell and can’t keep up with my work ethic and hustle.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, while you’re binge watching Netflix at night, I’m in the bed by 8:00 PM, awake at 3:45 AM the next morning, getting my shit done and at the office before you fools even have your first cup of coffee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a lot of things that I’m willing to take when people talk poorly of me. This is not one of them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I spend probably 50-60 hours a week on Push Digital, growing this company, bringing in new clients, just hustling so I can keep paying people because livelihoods depend on what I do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, if you’re watching this and you’re one of my competitors, look - we can compete all day on work and I can disagree with you. I think our agency’s better, our creative is better. But, one thing you’re never going to beat me on is hustle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, if you want to try then bring it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I will outwork you any day of the week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s how I’m able to build my company, complete Ironman, be a good husband, be a good father AND start other companies all at the same time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>You can’t outwork me. Don’t even try.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can go and try to say these things in pitches, trying to make it your differentiator.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

7366,"SC Craft Beer Facing Lots of Opposition","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The SC Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on our craft beer agenda hit some pretty big obstacles last week when half the paid lobbyist at the statehouse stood up against us. It really is a giant mess when our small businesses have to fight against such a well funded machine and their only talking point is ""this violates the three tier system?""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have to ask - so damn what!?!  What is so fundamental to our nation and state about the three tier system?  I'm not even trying to tear down their precious little stranglehold on small business but at this point I just have to ask why the hell that one talking point even matters. And to be perfectly clear - only like 3 SC breweries I've ever talked to even wants to distribute their own beer. We like working with our distributors. We have our hands full doing what we do. The last thing we want to do is take responsibility for distributing our own beer. But so what? What if we did want to distribute our own beer? No one has given us any good reason except ""it violates the three tier system."" <strong>GIVE ME REAL REASONS INSTEAD OF AN 86 YEAR OLD TALKING POINTS!</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's be clear about what's happening. The wholesalers in America are  desperately holding onto an antiquated system built in 1933 and it has absolutely nothing to do with craft breweries. Frankly, they don't give a shit about us. Here's what they care about...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li>In their eyes letting craft breweries have anything at all opens up the door for the big beer companies (MillerCoors AB InBev) to get the same. Because that's well over 90% of their income, they are using craft breweries as a wall that the big guys cannot cross.</li><li>Because the super majority of their income comes from the big beer companies, they do what those companies say and in this case it's making sure that craft breweries do not get a fair shake at competition. </li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Straight up - I know it, you know it and legislators know it - this is absolutely anti-free market. There is no reason to keep the three tier system in place except to allow one industry to control another. But we will keep playing this game and pretending that the three tier system is vital to the bedrock of Democracy. You know, it's in the Bill of Rights... Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Absolutely Control and Greed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just a couple decades ago before the transparency of the Internet and 24 hour cable news networks, rumor is that wholesalers kept their power through physical strength. Literally, they had hulked up drivers in communities threatening store owners, bartenders and even legislators. Or so I've been told by a couple Senators.

<p>The number of “cord cutters,” or individuals cutting back on or completely ditching their traditional cable television subscriptions, is rapidly increasing.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why are we so successful? We operate in the “Goldilocks zone” of digital. We’re old enough to have real-world campaign experience, but young enough to have the hustle, the drive and the proven digital expertise to deliver at the highest level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let me break this down:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>“America is all about speed. Hot, nasty, badass speed.” - Will Ferrell</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past April, we launched Tommy Tuberville’s bid for Alabama Senate. Not only will Tommy win, he is going to be a star in the upper chamber. Coach Tommy’s team called us at 4pm on a Friday and needed to launch a U.S. Senate campaign the following Monday. Here’s how the “Goldilocks zone” comes into play: The Push Digital team was experienced enough to understand the magnitude of the undertaking and know every element that needed to be completed, and we were young and energetic enough to damn the torpedoes, work through the weekend and get it done fast! Our partners and clients can always rely on us to get things done with diligence and precision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Burnt Fingers, Ask For Tongs</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every campaign is different, but you see enough of them and muscle memory kicks into gear. &nbsp;Again, we’re in the “Goldilocks zone” with institutional knowledge of how big, competitive races need to be executed. We’re a team who’s managed (literally) hundreds of digital campaigns and has refined the process. The procedural integrity of this team is tight because we’ve done it over and over again. We’ve seen what has worked, what has failed and learned lessons along the way. I promise your 50+ year-old TV media guy who “does digital” has no idea why we used a particular emoji in social copy and doesn’t keep an archive of UTM codes. Every move is strategically made because we’re constantly revising our methods and adding to the algorithm that is Push Digital.</p>

<p>I don’t want the title of this article to give you the wrong impression. We work to elect U.S. Senators as part of a team of very talented, very specialized consultants. But one of the reasons we’ve been able to be a part of these incredible races is our commitment to being team players and offering the very best of our talents to the whole group. It’s always my goal for everyone on the campaign—staff and consultants included—to walk into Election Day knowing “Push Digital hustled their ass off and delivered for me.”</p>

<p>I’ll never forget the first time <a href=""https://stopsoldiersuicide.org"">Stop Soldier Suicide</a> came into the Push Digital office in the Summer of 2018. Initial onboarding meetings with clients typically go the same. But this meeting was different. In this meeting we listened. We listened and we learned. We listened to Stop Soldier Suicide’s co-founder and former Army Ranger tell us about all those close to him that have taken their own lives. We learned that 20 service members and veterans a day take their own life.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>20.</strong><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Every </strong><strong><em>single</em></strong><strong> day.</strong><br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a lost soldier, airman, marine, or a veteran - every 72 minutes.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remember thinking at that moment - “I want Push Digital to take on this project, and I want to lead it.”<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was unlike any other project Push Digital had worked on before. Navigating a topic as sensitive as soldier and veteran suicide is no easy task, but remembering the impact that Stop Soldier Suicide is having on the lives of our service members and their families, and our veterans makes it worth it.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since beginning our partnership in July of 2018, we have been able to help Stop Soldier Suicide achieve goals that have surprised even us - month after month.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What Stop Soldier Suicide Does:</strong> As the nation’s first veteran-founded-and-led 501(c)3 nonprofit, Stop Soldier Suicide helps active duty members, veterans, and their fmailies navigate the maze of the thousands of resources available to them.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Their Mission/Goals: </strong>To see a day where veterans and active duty service members are at no greater risk of suicide than their peers who have not served. Their digital goals were to increase brand awareness and build a community of supporters to aid their mission.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Push’s Strategy:</strong> Create engaging and emotional digital content that would help build Stop Soldier Suicide’s audience and get the word out about the work Stop Soldier Suicide is doing.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Check out some of the awesome video projects we’ve pulled off for Stop Soldier Suicide. If they don’t spark some sort of motivation to help or desire to get involved, you’re simply not human.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Tina’s video, we knew it was important to use her social media videos to help showcase the depth and excitement of her candidacy. Using the candidate’s self-shot home videos adds an extra layer of authenticity and context to the story you’re trying to tell.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think about it — if everyone is using mobile videos to tell their own story on social media, wouldn’t integrating that medium be helpful when telling the story of a candidate?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mobile videos take no time to make. Likewise, every candidate between the ages of 18 and 45 years old has a couple of good ones laying around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

7502,"The Importance of Conceptual Thinking","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the creative realm, there is a clear difference between superficial, decorative work and conceptual work. But when you try to examine the differences between the two, it can be tough to find a guide on the subject. Here’s one perspective:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A charcoal drawing or oil painting of household objects – oranges, a flower vase, some gloves, a bird’s feather from the yard – is a still life. And there’s nothing wrong with that. But it’s decoration. It isn’t saying to the viewer anything other than “look at these subtle variances of light and shadow.” It isn’t doing anything besides conveying a representation of an inanimate thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But take that same style of artwork – charcoal drawing, oil painting, whatever – and select a different set of objects. Instead of fruit and a burlap sack, try depicting the warm glow of a Jedi’s lightsaber on top of some spare droid parts and a folded robe. Instead of ordinary flowers spilling out of a porcelain vase, try representing the flowers as two-dimensional, digital pixels. If you maintain enough similarities with the original mode of execution (in this case, the aesthetic of a traditional still life), you’ll change just enough of the outcome to create a visual statement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One relatively easy way to conceptualize in a creative way is by combining mundane elements that wouldn’t ordinarily go together. For instance, there’s nothing particularly remarkable about a formal suit you’d wear to a wedding, or camouflage attire you’d put on before going out into the woods to hunt in – but combine the two things, and you have a camouflage dress suit. A ‘fashion statement,’ which is just another phrase for creative – or conceptual - clothing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><em>In the creative realm, there is a clear difference between superficial, decorative work and conceptual work.</em></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In marketing, concept is hugely important. It’s one of the main reasons why memes are so effective as a social awareness tool for marketing campaigns. Juxtaposing topical elements in a contradictory way that’s instantly recognizable without explanation is almost unparalleled in terms of effectiveness and the potential for something to go viral. If the concept is strong enough, the aesthetics or technical impressiveness of a given image, or video, or bit of writing, are rendered all but irrelevant. Memes don’t need to look good in order to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At <a href=""https://pushdigital.com"">Push Digital</a>, our designers value the importance of concept across all areas of advocacy, brands, political, and strategic communications. Among many other things, we are visual problem solvers. We ensure that no campaign – no matter how large or small – begins without a goal in mind and a clear way to get there.</p>

<p><strong>6. Campaigns do not allow destructive people in their ranks.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We surround ourselves with loyal teammates and would never get in the bunker with someone who would drop the grenade. We fire very quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Businesses on the other hand let people just linger and soak up precious resources. Take the feelings out of the equation and cut people.</p>

<p><strong>7. Campaigns don’t let lawyers get involved in messaging. Ever!</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lawyers are there to answer one question - will this get me in trouble? &nbsp;They stay in their lane. Don’t let lawyers scare you into inaction. Don’t let them bully their way into your meeting.</p>

<p><strong>8. Let numbers make the decision for you.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Egos in business can often get in the way of good decision making and everyone wants to prove their worth by giving their opinion. On the campaign trail - you follow the poll because that's your path to victory. The data is the final arbiter of what a good idea or bad idea is or isn’t.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So while political campaigns may be the nightmare of every HR professional, their ability to get shit done is something every corporation should emulate and scale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have done so at my agency and yes, these changes bread hostility in the workplace, but you can negate that on the front end if you know what you’re walking into.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Have a great night full of positive vibes.</p>

7533,"11 Do's & Don'ts of Crisis Communication","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether you’re in business or politics, crises are inevitable. That’s just a fact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Accidents and terrible situations are going to occur, but how you handle those situations could not be more crucial. So, what do you do if you ﬁnd yourself in a crisis? Respond quickly, eﬀectively, eﬃciently and in a sincere manner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or you can follow the Push Digital 3 Step System:<br>1. Tell it all. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. Tell it fast. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. Tell the truth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Believe it or not, following those 3 simple steps is more diﬃcult than you would think. However, thanks to our work with larger corporations and our combined 50+ years of campaign experience, we’ve compiled a comprehensive list of dos and please-whatever-you-do-don’t-do-thats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So here they are…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. DO get all the facts.<br>If you ﬁnd yourself in a crisis, before you can even think about controlling the narrative, you have to gather ALL of the facts. Step one is talking to every single person involved. Literally everyone. Step two is all about keeping calm. Remember that there are multiple sides to every story, so try not to jump to conclusions. Step three is expect the unexpected. Work with the facts and not your feelings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. DO own it and apologize.<br>Time is crucial, so respond quickly and admit the mistake. Then proceed to apologize, again and again....and again. Be sincere and simple in apologizing, even if the absolute truth is more complicated and blame isn't necessarily singular.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. DO the right thing.<br>Even if you’re one single person or a corporation with millions of employees, morals can get messy and, for that, we have just one piece of advice: Do the right thing. Period. Then make sure your audience knows how you plan to ﬁx it and the timeline for completing. Being open and transparent in this situation could not be more important. Don’t fake it till you make it because the internet trolls will know.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4. DON'T dwell on the mistake.<br>We all know the mistake happened, you owned up to it, and hopefully by now you’ve ﬁxed it. In politics OR business, you should recognize every crisis as an opportunity, and pivot to a positive note while you’ve still got everyone’s attention. Eventually, the media and press will die down and when it does you’ve already discovered a new path to victory and your team is cruising through the punch list.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5. DO rebuild your brand.<br>The media and the trolls have knocked you down… and now it’s time to get back up. Rebuild the brand by looking for opportunities to prove you've corrected the crisis and reinforce your brand principles. Reward customer loyalty and give new customers a reason to do business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>6. DO know the battlefield.<br>In today’s world… the Internet is and will always be the battleﬁeld. Every single day until forever… things don’t just go away.<br>1. Post Wisely - Keep your digital footprint in check.<br>2. Know Your Opponent - Learn from their mistakes so you don’t have to.<br>3. Be Relevant - Make time for making yourself and your business better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>7. DO know your opponent.<br>In politics, your opponent could be the very reason you’re running for public ofﬁce. But in business, it could be your competitor, the janitor or a radical activist. Sometimes the real enemy isn’t clear to you or to the public. So, make sure you know who you are ﬁghting. Deﬁne them. Understand them. Set the agenda. Expose them. Learn from them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>8. DO talk to an attorney. DON'T let them keep you from responding.<br>Attorneys are important to keep you out of jail… but they can also gum up the system and make it impossible for you to respond quick enough. Attorneys are risk averse. By nature, they are. “Should we take a risk, or should we NOT take a risk?” “Not.” What you are really looking for is an evaluation of the risk, not a total avoidance of it. Because, ultimately, you will have to make the call if you are in charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>9. DON’T feed the trolls. DO feed the beast.<br>You won’t make Internet trolls happy no matter how many questions you answer.<br>1. Humor The Trolls - Comedic relief is brilliant but be careful because humor is not universal.<br>2. Counter-Fact The Trolls - Engage the trolls with the cold, hard facts and address the crisis head-on.<br>3. Don’t Join The Trolls - Don’t stoop to their level. Very rarely does corporate trolling pan out as originally intended.<br>4. But Do Feed The Beast - During a crisis, content is key, so be prepared and have quality items ready to go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>10. DO measure.<br>How often should you poll? Let us ask you this: how often are vital signs taken during a medical emergency? Constantly. That may be more often than is practical or affordable for your company, but the short answer is: measure public sentiment as often as you can. Then poll again. And again. Make an adjustment. And poll again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>11. DON'T wait until a crisis to have a crisis team in place.<br>There are many tips to get you through a crisis, but every single of of them relies on a solid team who is ready to mobilize the second a crisis hits, because you aren’t going to have time once the shit hits the fan. Don’t put too many cooks in the kitchen. The team must be small enough to move quickly and efﬁciently. Remember, Nick Fury assembled The Avengers before the aliens attacked New York.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s it! I mean, well… there’s a whole lot more to it when we dive into the specifics of each individual crisis but for the most part, things tend to fall under those 11 big rules. We’re going to dive even further into each rule here on this channel soon. Thanks for listening.</p>

7545,"Digital Has Changed Who We Are As A Species","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of us think of technology and the Internet as a tool used to reach people for marketing purposes. We tend to think of it as something very similar to TV, radio, mail, and billboards. It is however something very very different.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here at Push Digital we argue that while it can and is used as a tool for marketing it has become much more than just that. In fact it has become the next step in human evolution. Until you understand how it has changed us as a species you will not be able to use it effectively in your marketing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":15270} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://pushdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Changing-As-Species-Blog.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-15270""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a recent podcast interview Elon Musk was asked at what point do humans become cyborgs. Musk responded that we are already cyborgs and we don't even realize it. We are cyborgs because we have these devices connected to us at all times but they're not our pockets they're in our hands. The only thing that will change in the future is the speed at which that data gets from the device to your brain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are heading in that direction and there's no turning back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You already know that digital is changing a lot of industries around the world including the transportation industry, the hotel industry, and the entertainment industry. Donald Trump was elected president because of the internet and every day he is disrupting the media industry with his Twitter account. He's bypassing the media and going straight to us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Digital is also changing the way laws are made. In 2016 Push Digital ran a digital campaign targeted at the South Carolina Statehouse which aided in a 600 million dollar gas tax increase to fix the state's crumbling roads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's not just industries, the Internet is changing us. Most obviously it is changing the way we socialize. Social media has 100% of our attention, and that isn't changing any time soon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":15288} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://pushdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Slide33-1024x576.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-15288""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So why is all this happening and what does it mean for you? It's happening because that thing in your hand is your one stop shop for everything - your phone, camera, alarm clock, calculator, compass, and so much more. Most importantly your ability to access all the content ever created in the history of the world and the ability to connect with anyone around the world at a moment's notice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And what that means is that we know every single thing about you. All the scary stories you hear about privacy ... Pretty true. Your privacy is gone. There is no going back. You accepted that the moment you put all these devices in your pocket. Complaining about it is like standing butt naked in front of a window and being angry that everyone can see you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While this might be scary for you as an individual, it's very good for marketers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We no longer have to throw a campaign out there and see what sticks. Now we can target&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>with content&nbsp;<em>you</em>care about. This is what we do at Push Digital.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, in the future this won't be limited to just your phone. Connected TV is next - stay tuned.</p>

<p>What you do is a reflection of who you are. Every action tells us something about you. Don’t be one of those people who show us some fake digital version of who you want to be. Be honest. Be transparent. Showing us your true self will make you want to live a true life. Then you actually become the person you’re pretending to be. Mondays are a day for a hard reset as you’re coming off the weekend showing us that fake digital life.&nbsp;</p>

7570,"Choosing to Fight... Another Day","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take a smaller step today. Last night I deactivated my Twitter account for awhile. I’ll jump back on later but yesterday I just decided that I didn’t need that constant barrage of fighting, drama and negativity. It was just a bunch of people saying things to each other&nbsp;that they would never say to a person’s face. I felt so much anger building up in my heart, so I said “enough is enough.” And by now, you all know me. I don’t shy away from a fight. I get sucked right in. That’s the key to failure. The best way to change my behavior is to eliminate the environment. No negativity. Positivity only because positivity fuels creativity, work ethic and success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This seems like such a cliche statement. It’s so simple, right? In reality this is one of the hardest things to implement, especially when it involves removing people from your life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your Daily Positive Vibes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I understand that some of you will be offended by the language. I urge you to research David Goggins and pick up his book “Can’t Hurt Me.” It’s now one of my top five favorite books. Warning: it’s like crack to super motivated people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some people use their past as an excuse. Some people use their past as fuel.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Which are you?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I made a decision decades ago to never forget my past. Instead I dwell on it. I remind myself every day of the horrible things I’ve seen. I vowed to never see them again. Then I vowed to be a successful person. Later I vowed to raise a family the complete opposite way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Goggins is right. You can come from serious crap and become something completely different if you use the crap as fuel in your engine. As for me, I’m not the “baddest motherfucker on the planet” but I have done a few awesome things and I’m working on a whole lot more. I thank God that I came from the sewer. I wouldn’t have any of this had I not.</p>

<p>Your Daily Positive Vibes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I made a mistake. Yesterday I reactivated my Twitter account to respond to a reporter’s tweet. I was immediately attacked by a Columbia politico who is absolutely one of the most vile humans I’ve ever met. There’s nothing positive about this lobbyist, his character or his actions. He is the embodiment of negativity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everything in me wanted to respond but I did not. I realized that I can not control this person’s actions. More devastating is that his&nbsp;personal attack threw me off track, disturbed my focus and stopped me from enjoying time with my family. He put me in a foul mood. Fortunately my mood is something I can control. I re-deactivated my Twitter account and instead decided to focus on what I can control - my own successes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have a rule - if something doesn’t fall into one of these categories I don’t focus on it all:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. Spending time with family<br>2. Building a relationship with God<br>3. Building wealth<br>4. Crossing finish lines<br>5. Finding peace</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those are things I can control. Things and people I cannot control are irrelevant. They only get in the way of success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Focus on the positive. Ignore the negative.</p>

<p>Wishing you so many Positive Vibes today.</p>

7587,"Can't Find Solutions? Dismiss your Vampires.","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Your Daily Positive Vibes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I strongly suggest that you read The Energy Bus by Jon Gordon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clemson fans - Gordon works with Clemson a lot and doesn’t shut up in his books about Dabo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gamecock fans - yes, you may want to vomit but I promise the book is still a must-read. And I hate to admit it, Dabo can teach us all something about positive leadership.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, last year I read his book and immediately hung this sign in our conference room. It’s a reminder that we won’t accept negative vibes in our meetings. No excuses. No whining. No complaints. We are meeting to find solutions to problems faced by our clients. Period. Negativity concentrates on problems. Positivity concentrates on solutions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vampires who suck the positivity out of our meetings will be dismissed. Vampires who suck the positivity out of our company will be dismissed permanently. Far too often we have let these vampires stay around the company and they became a cancer that spread to everyone else. I no longer let that happen, even if the employee is a stellar worker. Attitude matters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve taken that same stance on life. I eliminate those people from my circle completely. You know who I’m talking about. They always have drama. They’re always sick. Something in their life is always going wrong. All is dark.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good friends try to help those people, but sometimes a vampire just cannot be turned. So you must drive a stake right through it’s heart. Okay, not really. You just cut them loose. Sometimes that in turn causes even more drama, but that drama is short-lived and the long term benefits are so numerous they cannot be counted.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wishing you so many Positive Vibes and for you to be surrounded by positive people!</p>

7590,"""Love Thy Neighbor"" - Matthew 22:39","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Your Daily Positive Vibes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Immigration, abortion, taxes, gay rights, guns. Things can get pretty hot here on social media. I’ve made it a rule in recent years to address every single issue by asking two questions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. How does the second greatest commandment impact my position on this issue?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. How does the second greatest commandment impact how I talk to people about this issue?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all know that I’ve fallen short of my own rule and that’s created quite the firestorm on a couple occasions. Some I’ve done to myself. Some have been attacks from others. People have taken my words out of context, they’ve cut out a sentence or two from a full statement to make me something I’m not and they’ve even lied about my comments. Still, I know who I am and I return to my rule even when I want to lash out at everyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe you’re an atheist or you worship a different God. Even so, this one simple rule transcends all and should be applied across the board. Just think of how much negativity we could all remove from our lives if we simply follow the second greatest commandment.</p>

7597,"Place Priorities Where You Can See Them","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your Daily Positive Vibes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yesterday I wrote that Mondays are a day to reset and to focus on your priorities. That begs the question - what are your priorities?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mine are simple:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. Be a good husband and father.<br>2. Get closer to God.<br>3. Grow my little business empire and concentrate on financial education.<br>4. Train for my next IRONMAN.<br>5. Relax daily and find mental clarity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without listing and reviewing my priorities I find that my day and my mind become completely cluttered with unimportant tasks that only get in the way of what’s most important. That creates unneeded stress and many negative vibes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I keep my list posted to my closet wall and as the background in my iPhone so that I’m reminded all day everyday. It keeps me focused. And focus builds Positive Vibes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wishing the most Positive Vibes ever on your Tuesday.</p>

<p><br>Your Daily Positive Vibes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh this one is so dang hard for me. No matter how hard I try to break it I have this habit of trying to make everyone happy. I want everyone to like me. So I overcommit, get super stressed and I fill my soul with negative vibes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I decided to do 2019 different and to start saying “NO.” If something doesn’t fit into one of my main five priorities than my immediate reaction is to decline.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is one exception. At least once per week I try to go out of my way to help someone else. While that doesn’t on the surface look like it fits into one of my priorities, I think it’s what God would want and that strengthens my relationship with Him, which is a top priority.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other than that, “NO” it is. That focuses me on priorities, that gives me more successes and those give me lots of Positive Vibes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How can you eliminate clutter from your life by saying “no” today?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Empathy: the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What would happen if we spent some time listening to another person’s views rather than just yelling at everyone online?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s been my goal for the last five years. Admittedly, it has been hard since my big abortion flap when, instead of folks listening to my view, I was silenced by the mob and even people within my own circle.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While that has opened my eyes to the state of the internet and of this nation as a whole, I’m trying very hard to not let that deter me. Instead of running my mouth, I’m trying to not only listen, but to put myself in the speaker’s shoes. I may not agree, but I can at least see their point of view and that’s a great starting place for a real discuss rather than just an argument.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, of course no one really wants a discussion in this day and age. They want to fight, yell the loudest and claim victory. And of course that has created an atmosphere of extreme negative vibes and what I believe is the beginning of our nation’s downfall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still I am optimistic that this great nation can rebound. I believe it starts with listening more than talking. Maybe then we can spread more Positive Vibes.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s 7:30 am and I’m just now waking up. My alarm went off like it does every morning at 3:45 am and I just turned that crap off. I’m finally starting to listen to my body. This week on the road has been a ball buster and I’m exhausted. All to say, today’s Positive Vibes will be short.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few months back I started a daily routine of listing out ten things I’m grateful for. Some are big. Some are small. I’m always sure to be more specific than “my wife” or “my kids.” The whole purpose is to remind myself that life is pretty damn awesome. And that brings tons of Positive Vibes.</p>

<p>I ask you now - what are you grateful for today? You don’t have to give me ten. Give me one or two.</p>

<p>Here is my list from yesterday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. The bacon at the DC Trump Hotel.<br>2. Running on the mall.<br>3. 66 degree weather.&nbsp;<br>4. Everything bagels.<br>5. Having drinks with my very first mentor and getting really good advice.<br>6. My rainbow seersucker pants.<br>7. Spreading positive cheer for all to hear.<br>8. Super productive meetings in DC means I’m not wasting time.<br>9. Not being hung over is the best.<br>10. Just thinking about getting home to my family today makes me happy.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How is that positive? Let me tell you...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you pay attention to all these Instafools you will think success is so damn easy. Get six pack abs, run a marathon, start a business, work everyday from the beach. They’re all showboating and selling complete bullshit.</p>

<p>That’s why you don’t just see me posting pictures of finish lines or gloating about landing a big client. I share my struggles with you because you need to see what it really takes. It’s frigging hard. All of it. People need to see that because if they think it’s all easy and then they hit rough spots, they will give up thinking they just aren’t as good as those Instafools. It’s just not possible for them. And that’s not true.</p>

<p>Your Daily Positive Vibes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m coming to you late today. It’s been a crazy yet productive Monday. So I was thinking while on my run today that when we talk about positivity we so often think about what we can add to our lives. I need this or I want that. Today I encourage you to do the opposite and ask yourself - what can I eliminate today?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You probably know by now that the Donehue family is moving. Don’t worry... or celebrate if you’re some. We are only moving about two miles down the road. Elizabeth’s childhood home hit the market and it’s nicer and more suited for a family of our size. While packing we are taking the time to really purge. Yesterday I loaded up the truck multiple times for trips to the dump and to Goodwill. It felt so good to eliminate so much clutter and junk from my life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also this week I’m really focusing on eliminating alcohol from at least four days. I have at least two to three drinks every single night and it’s really impacting my training, which is ramping up starting today. Crossing finish lines brings me more joy than daily drinking and damn those beers taste so much better after a race.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve found that eliminating crap from my life brings me many more Positive Vibes than adding. So today I ask - what can you eliminate from your life to bring you more positivity?</p>

<p>Your Daily Positive Vibes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The whole Frothy debacle a few months back did not happen because I said something crazy or “offensive.” It happened because we now live in a time when everyone wants to silence the opposition , especially public figures, with threats of embarrassment and boycotts. That doesn’t mean the debacle wasn’t my fault. It was.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Truth be told, I’m a phenomenal public relations and campaign strategist - one of the best in South Carolina and in this country.&nbsp;Yet for some stupid reason I ignored the advice I give my clients. Now I give that advice to you because it’s one of the best things you can do to avoid negativity and to find so many more Positive Vibes in your day.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here it is - stop getting sucked into social media arguments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m not saying to let the opposition scare you into silence. I’m saying that you should speak up on issues important to you. You should be yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, our social feeds are full of hundreds of opportunities for fights every day and I see so many friends getting sucked in. Hell, that was me for a long time. I fixed that problem and then somehow I fell right back into it earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Facebook and especially Twitter give you all the opportunities you need to fight, make enemies, be put in a bad mood, ruin your day and sometimes even ruin your life. Why is making your point worth all that? Trust me, it’s not. Ignore the social BS, move on, smile at your success in not engaging and let your heart be full of Positive Vibes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh, and let your voice be heard, debate with your polite friends and ignore the those who can’t debate without being a jerk. Stand up for your beliefs. You can do that without engaging in every fight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Your Daily Positive Vibes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""Our actions may be impeded but there can be no impeding our intentions or dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>- Marcus Aurelius</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some folks use their hardships as an excuse to fail in everything, even in life. Others use their struggles as the fuel behind their successes. Roman Emperor and Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius wrote these words over 1,800 years ago understanding that the crappiest parts of our lives are also the most important. What you think is the impediment to your success is actually what will lead to your success. That wall you have to climb will teach you how to climb walls and make you stronger for when another wall appears. And yes, a lot more walls will appear on your path.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Personally, I deal with drama and stress far better than most humans I know. It’s my super power. I was brought up in a home full of both physical and emotional violence. I experienced things no child should ever experience. At the time I cried, I hid under beds with my sister and I begged for it all to end. What I didn’t realize is that it calloused my mind. It built a suit of armor around my thoughts. It gave me all the tools I need to do everything I’m doing right now. I would not be the man I am today without the violent childhood. Truly, what stood in the way became the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Negativity fills our lives, especially as social media fuels more divisiveness in our nation. It may seem at first glance that the negativity is our downfall, but I believe it is simply the “obstacle to our acting.” The negativity is exactly what we need to become more positive people because we will learn how to ignore it, smile and spread positivity both internally and externally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So today when you feel the negativity coming on, remember that this experience will teach you how to deal with negativity so that you can lead a life full of Positive Vibes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m wishing you more Positive Vibes than you can stand today.</p>

7627,"What Would You Change Today If You Had No Tomorrow?","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your Daily Positive Vibes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How many days do you have left?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The answer is that you have absolutely no idea. We all want to think that we will live into our 80s or 90s. I’m sure that’s the answer my mother, father and step-father would have given.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But my mother died at 48. My father died at 57. My step-father died at 58.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WOW! This Positive Vibes post is starting off pretty dark, huh?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s hard to imagine that in just nine years I will be the age of my mother when she died. And frankly, that scares me a bit. But the one that impacts me the most is my step-father, Robert. His death is the one I think about the most and the one I thought about as soon as I woke up this morning. I’m not exactly sure why but I think it’s because his was the one that could not be avoided while both my mother’s and father’s departures were self-inflicted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While this has little to do with the point of my post, I feel the need to write about him for a few minutes. Robert and I did not get along when I was a child and through my teenage years. I didn’t appreciate what he did for me and I felt a lot of resentment that my mother remarried. We couldn’t have been more different. He was a blue collar worker and I was a total geek and bookworm. He liked to hunt. I didn’t like getting dirty. He was a man’s man. I wasn’t.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then I went to college and grew up. I realized how much he did for two kid’s who were not his. He started his own company and became successful and I really admired him. We became drinking buddies. We became actual friends. Then my mother died and we became even closer. One of my favorite memories in my entire life was of him attending Jim DeMint’s US Senate victory party and him telling me how proud he was of me.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I proposed to Elizabeth I asked him to be my best man. He went silent and I heard sniffles. I didn’t realize it would mean so much to him. A bit later he called and asked “so what is a father supposed to pay for in all this?” I told him not to worry about it and that I would find a way to pay for the rehearsal dinner. I will never forget that he replied “hell no! I’m paying.” My real father didn’t even attend my wedding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Robert and I continued to grow closer. A couple short years later he was diagnosed with brain cancer. He passed away in 2008.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back to my point - I miss Robert dearly and his death completely changed me. Robert did nothing wrong and his time came way too early. I don’t know when my time will come (and I don’t like writing that as my airplane is taking off), but I’ve vowed to myself to make every single day count. I hustle the way I do because I had three parents die young.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I average just the lifespan of my three parents that’s 54 years old, only 15 years from today. That’s not a lot of time. Tim McGraw sings that we should “live like we are dying.” And that’s exactly what I’m doing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So here’s my question to you today - how would you change your life if you knew you would die young?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How would you maximize your days? How would you eliminate negativity and bring more positivity into your life? Would you surround yourself with all the bullshit dominating each of our lives?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps it’s time to start living a life full of positivity.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps you should start today. Because you don’t know how many more days you have left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m wishing you nothing but Positive Vibes to fill your Thursday!</p>

<p>Your Daily Positive Vibes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What a Friday! I’m totally bogged down helping a big client and my mind is a bit too cluttered to give you a thoughtful note today. Let me just say this...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We came into 2019 in the worst place we’ve ever been. I was hurting bad and in a total state of depression. I thought the sky was falling. Everything was dark.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I huddled up with my leadership team and developed a plan. We hustled our faces off over the last seven months, followed through on every single point of that plan and just last week I officially labeled the plan COMPLETE AND CLOSED.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Honestly, I think Push is now on the most solid foundation we’ve ever been on. Our staff is back up to it’s highest levels and we have a big roster of clients. We are also totally streamlined, more organized and moving faster than ever before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All to say, sometimes you have to take a few steps back to make huge leaps forward. So when you get kicked in the gut and you think you’ll be down forever, go into a cave with your allies, write a plan and stick to that plan. Hustle your face off!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good things will happen and your negativity will turn to positivity. Maybe not immediately. It may take a few months or even a couple years, but Positive Vibes are right around the corner if you STICK TO THE PLAN!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope your Friday and your weekend is full of nothing but Positive Vibes!</p>

<p>Your Daily Positive Vibes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I cried this morning. I gotta tell you, I’ve become quite the crier since having kids. All kinds of things just hit me right in the heart. Happy things. Sad things. Things I would never expect. Unfortunately today was a very sad thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right before my run I checked Twitter and read the story of Andre and Jordan Anchondo who were killed in the El Paso mass shooting. Jordan died shielding her two-month-old son, who survived and is expected to make a&nbsp;full recovery. Jordan was confirmed dead a few hours later. They leave behind three children - ages 5, 2 and 2 months old. These children are nearly exactly the ages of our three boys.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I closed my eyes during my run and thought of my in-laws sitting our boys down and telling them that mommy and daddy were now in Heaven. I lost it. These things seem so far away yet they hit so close to home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s hard to write about positivity today because I’m pretty sad. And reading everyone fighting online trying to score political points is making me even more sad.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today pray for all the victims of this weekend’s shootings and especially for the Anchondo children. And don’t let any online activist tell you it’s not okay to pray. We need a lot of changes in this nation but before any of that’s done we should pray for the people who are devastated right now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you find any positivity in this remember that nothing you’re dealing with right now is even close to what the Anchondo children are dealing with. Your life is pretty damn good! So as I said last week… go live it up because you have no idea when your day is coming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope you can find some positivity in a dark day.</p>

<p>Your Daily Positive Vibes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Talking about money is always an uncomfortable topic, so hey, let’s talk about money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I make decent money. I’m not rich, but I do okay. Note I didn’t say “I bring home decent money.” There’s a huge difference.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t buy fancy suits or expensive cars. I’m the last person you’ll see wearing one of those jewelry type watches or buying boats. Instead I am focused on building Push Digital and my investment portfolio. Most of what I make goes right back into what made me money in the first place - my businesses. My goal is to grow an empire through my holding company.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s just one problem with that, which brings me to the whole point of this post - I don’t know anything about finances. I mean absolutely nothing. I’m a smart strategist, a damn good creative and a strong leader. I know how to build businesses and operational structures. But I know jack shit about money. I didn’t go to school for business. I never planned on being an entrepreneur. This all happened through hustle. And straight up y’all, I’m a financial DUMBASS!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So over the past six months I’ve spent the majority of my time at work and any free time I can find improving my financial education. I’ve read two books per week. I read the Wall Street Journal daily. Anytime I get the urge to check social media I check the markets or turn on CNBC instead. I’ve taken five online classes, including real estate investment courses. I’ve signed up for seminars which I will be taking later this year. I’m doing all the things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have identified a barrier to my long term goals and I’m working tirelessly to tear down that barrier. Accomplishing my goals is what brings me Positive Vibes but right now I’m feeling a lot of negativity because I do not have the knowledge I need to get it all done.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I want it bad, but I didn’t even know where to begin. So I just picked a book, then another, and then another until I found a path forward. I’ve wasted time trying to find that path but I feel very comfortable now that I’m heading exactly in the direction I want to head. Today I’m full of Positive Vibes because I’m figuring that shit out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope you’ll forgive the uncomfortable conversation about money and see the ultimate point I’m trying to make - too many of us want to do big things but feel inadequate or even the inability to begin. Screw that! Eliminate the barriers in the way of you reaching your goal and just begin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Want to lose 20 pounds? Get off the couch and start moving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Want to take your career to the next level? Get off Facebook and start hustling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Want to learn how to play the harmonica? Sign up for lessons. Okay, this one is mine and it’s coming!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reach for those Positive Vibes! Stop pretending that barriers are permanent. Very few are! Don’t let negativity and doubt get the best of you. You got this!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope you find all the Positive Vibes you need to crush your goals.</p>

<p>I posted today’s story a bit earlier but decided to take it down because I talked about our kids and after the Frothy debacle where pictures of our children were attacked, I thought the post was a bit too transparent.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have to tell you... I absolutely hate reality TV. But what I hate even more is when people talk about how their life sucks or how they don’t have what they want or how they can’t do big things AND they watch reality TV.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think about it, folks. Instead of living their lives to the fullest people are sitting in front of a TV and watching other people live... people who cause as much drama as they can. These attention whores purposefully spread negativity and then have little girls and douche canoe guys want to be just like them. It’s pitiful. And sad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This might offend you if you’re one of them, but I’m going to give it to you straight. I think you are less of a person if you are obsessed with reality TV. I don’t mean inherently as in you should be treated like less of a person. I mean that you are less because you could be more. It’s simple math. Five is less than ten and your life resume has five fewer awesome experiences because you are watching other people experience life. You could be improving yourself, your family or your community. You could be making more money to travel to see amazing things. Instead you are just improving the ego and the financial status of the worst of America.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a few reality television shows that spread good, but the super majority of them doing nothing but put negativity into your soul. Is that really how you want to live?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I truly believe with all my heart that America took a turn for the worse when reality TV entered our lives. It changed how we all act and more importantly, how we talk to each other. It normalized drama and negativity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have a challenge for you. Turn off of the reality television shows tonight and use that time improving yourself and filling your heart with positivity instead of drama.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LIVE YOUR LIFE INSTEAD OF WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE LIVE THEIRS!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Add experiences to your life resume. That’s how you find all the Positive Vibes this world has to offer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Today’s is more of a praise report. Lots of folks have been asking about the condition of my heart post procedure. I’m happy to report that after three weeks of hard training I’ve had no incidents like I was having.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today we hit 32 miles on the bike followed by a five mile run in extreme heat and humidity. My heart rate is back to normal. I’m not quite back to my normal speeds and I’m more fatigued than usual. I’m also having occasional flutters. All of&nbsp;that was predicted and expected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m feeling good and on track to be back to my normal self, Jingling all the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A quick thank you to MUSC and especially CEO Dr Pat Cawley for sending me to the right man, and that right man cardiologist Dr Michael Field who diagnosed and fixed me up very quickly with amazing support, follow up and overall phenomenal customer service. The folks at MUSC were amazing after months of working with a different team who didn’t seem to care about finding the problem and who even threatened not to help me if I continued doing endurance events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m not 100% yet but I’m definitely back on track to take on my big fall races.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thank you for all the kind messages!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a picture of me typing out my funeral plans. No, seriously. Here me out...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yesterday I had the honor of serving as an usher at the funeral for my F3 brother Mark Smith. His F3 name was Wilson, as in the ball from the movie Castaway. It’s because he flew those big cargo jets in the US Air Force.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s just something about a military funeral that hits you in the heart harder than civilian funerals. The gun salute, the playing of taps, the folding of the flag and handing it to the family, half the crowd in uniform and saluting and in this case, a fly over from what I think was a C-17 (what do I know?) All of it to remember a really great guy I got to know during F3 bootcamps, a man who cared deeply for his nation and his local community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While ushering with me,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100011041928524&amp;__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARAUEO2ybozleTsVyufmadv_1A8MB1nh_tLJX2wJOKuh4RDwK8SK-Plze0pbasq5IObH_Y9SDPe8BObm&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBPlpXzYV2PG9O9_do7al0aTvCo8KZ3dezmyw379sBv-ZzixXRTMtfP3ChkwCgh-zjMs-aUj-NOxeo-1KR9FQYhN8o4MgWsg-JqZM8bZfVHUe-5xtdaFr8eiyzdBGslr-O9--2H0_3J6Jf3KU-mgz7LoSjFeFBBjurjvFtbrg37Y3B3M2ome2IOvLN-yxq91cpL1XCA0nkQKozwhsIq3PcKdq5HtFGr6KdZxnqeT5g9GyQDcsARhc66aLRXJij2YMV_SfnKoI8mZyItoJ-nCNxJiWmc"">Eddie Crosby</a>&nbsp;(F3 Cousin) asked “have you planned your funeral?” He went on to say that handling the details myself would take a lot of stress off my family and give them the time they need to mourn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His question and statement hit me like a ton of bricks. At first I thought to myself “I have plenty of time to do that.” Then I thought “well, if I get sick I still have time.” Then I finally thought “well shit, what if there is an accident?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last night I couldn't shake Cousin's question so I started jotting down some notes. Yes, I want to save my family stress, but even more so this activity helps me face the inevitable and that makes me think about how short life is and how I want to maximize every day... how I want to build my life resume (tomorrow’s topic).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It all goes back to the post I published last week about my step-father, Robert. You might not live into your eighties or nineties. You may not have thirty or forty years left to “get around to it.” You might go out for a run and get hit by a car tomorrow. Do you really want to waste that time sitting on a couch?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not me!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m accepting that I’m going to die and that date could come sooner than I would like. That might be dark but it’s just like training for an event or studying for a test. That event is coming so I better get up early and train. That test is coming so you better study today. There might not be time to just cram it all in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In planning my funeral I accept the inevitable which forces me to look at today differently. It forces me to act - to build my relationship with God and to hustle to grow my companies and build wealth so that I can experience all that I can with my family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These posts aren’t supposed to necessarily spread cheer. It’s a discussion on how we can live more awesome lives full of positivity. I truly believe in this case that facing and accepting the negative builds a life of positivity! That’s my game plan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope you all have a week full of Positive Vibes. I also hope you will take 30 seconds out of your day today to pray for the Smith family. Wilson was a great dude taken way too early from his loving family.</p>

<p>Your Daily Positive Vibes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What exactly is life without positivity-fueled experiences?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>God gave us an entire planet to explore with a mind capable of limitless dreams and a resilient body able to explore the unseen and ready to make those dreams come true. Yet most of us sit idly by wasting the greatest gifts given to us by our maker. If that’s not an affront to God, I don’t know what is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So many of us concentrate on building our work resumes and never even consider what a life resume looks like, worse yet, how to actually build our life resume.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few questions to answer:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who are you?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What do you believe in?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What are your strengths?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What are the top moments in your life?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What awesome experiences do you want before you die to live a life full of Positive Vibes?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How do you spend your time?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Answer those questions and you can start building your life resume as it stands today and that will guide you to having an amazing life resume full of Positive Vibes in the future.</p>

<p>Jesse Itzler is one of my favorite “celebrities” because he’s an extremely successful entrepreneur, a dedicated family man and an avid endurance athlete. He’s the public person I most relate to. Ladies, you may know him more as the husband of Sara Blakely, the CEO of Spanx and one of the most successful female entrepreneurs in the country. Anyway, he posted his life resume yesterday along with this template. I urge you to create yours too. I'll post the link in the comments.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don't misunderstand, metrics&nbsp;<em>do matter -&nbsp;</em>but why you're measuring them matters more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two important things to think about when you bring metrics into the equation:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, Are you looking at the&nbsp;<em>right</em>&nbsp;metrics? Here are two examples my team deals with on a daily basis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Political campaigns </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Goal: Raise money </li><li>Metric of Importance:&nbsp;<strong>Conversion rate</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brand Reputation</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Goal: Change Opinions&nbsp;</li><li>Metric of Importance:&nbsp;<strong>Positive Engagement</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Second, do you understand what those metrics mean for you?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine if you walk into a doctor’s office and the doctor hands you an X-Ray and walks out of the room. He gives you no diagnosis, no prognosis and no plan of action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s just not how we roll.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We give you all the metrics - the real ones. We tell you what they are and why they matter. We tell you how they relate to our goal, what’s working and what’s not. Then we give you a plan of action to reach the win.</p>

<p><br>JP said to look serious but not angry. Unfortunately I only have two moods - Pissed or Pumped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, here's your (not so) Daily Positive Vibes</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a rule that I follow in just about everything I do, unless Netflix is involved. That rule — do one more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All week we’ve been moving homes, thus the reason for less blogging the last few days. Our new home is three stories and yes, that’s a massive pain in the ass when you have a ton of boxes. All week I kept telling myself “just get one more box of up those stairs.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At work it’s always one more email or one more call.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While training is always one more mile, one more lap or one more push up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It doesn’t matter what I’m doing. I will alway do one more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t want to stop when everyone else stops. I want to be the guy doing more. That’s how I grow to be better than I was yesterday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But sometimes it doesn’t stop at just one more. That’s also a great philosophy on how to take on huge tasks. As it’s said - the only way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time. Sometimes that's how you clean out an email inbox, get all the boxes upstairs or complete a marathon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yesterday I had no interest in running. My legs were completely shot to shit after taking all those boxes up thirty-two steps. After one mile I was ready to stop… Instead, I ran to the mailbox. Then I ran to one more mailbox. Then I ran to one more mailbox. And before I knew it I had run eight miles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last night I watched a motivational video by entrepreneur Jesse Itzler in which he said that he also follows the ""Do One More"" Rule. Awesome! But I thought I created this one. Jesse is a straight baller (Google him) so if I’m doing what he’s doing then I must be on the right track.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why don’t you try it today? In everything you do, do one more. I think you will find yourself feeling much more accomplished and totally full of POSITIVE VIBES.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This morning I woke up totally exhausted. I overslept by thirty minutes. My back hurt. Moving homes caught up to me. I just felt like garbage. The last thing I wanted to do was swim.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I got up to brush my teeth. I looked in the mirror and pointed at myself (kinda like in this picture but less douchey). I said out loud “you don’t have to swim this morning. You get to swim this morning. Jumping in that pool will take all your pain and stress away.” Literally, I said it out loud, even with my mouth full of tooth paste.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly everything changed, just like it does most of the time I don’t want to do something.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t have to get on this conference call. I get to build my business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t have to have this uncomfortable conversation. I get to move on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t have to run this mile. I get to be alone, away from all the stress, and decompress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This strategy doesn’t work every single time. Sometimes I’m just stuck in a bad place. You will be too. It’s unavoidable. But I will say that this strategy works about 80% of time just like it did this morning.</p>

7708,"Why You Should Make Your Goals Public","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>Your Daily Positive Vibes</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve longed believed in making my goals public and this week my opinion was validated by entrepreneur Jesse Itzler in a course I’m taking. Today I’m going to make a new goal and I’m asking for your help in making it happen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In making your goals public you are giving yourself a whole new level of accountability. You’re telling the world “I’m going to do this big thing.” Your friends and family begin asking you about the big thing. You find other people doing the big thing. Suddenly you have surrounded yourself with a ton of people who are watching you, helping you and expecting you to do the big thing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Personally, I don’t want to be embarrassed by not finishing the big thing. That fear of embarrassment forces me to do the big thing. If I kept it quiet then I could just give up with no outside pressure forcing me to keep going.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I tell everyone in the world about my goals. My professional goals, my fitness goals and my personal goals. And in doing so you have all been kind enough to hold me accountable. I appreciate you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You know that I have a big goal coming up - a half Ironman and three marathons all within six weeks. I would love to say that I’m doing everything right but that’s just not the case. I’m training, I’m eating right, I’m recovering and I even got the heart issue fixed. But there’s still one huge problem that I haven’t addressed effectively - my alcohol intake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This morning I woke up with only 26% recovery despite having a light day yesterday and getting sleep (see image in comments). It was due to heart rate variability issues and the only thing I can think that would cause it is the Red Bull and vodka and three glasses of Chardonnay I had after work. Alcohol causes heart inflammation and that’s really bad for endurance athletes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Look, I’m not an alcoholic. And yes, I know that’s what alcoholics say. I don’t feel the need to drink. I do, however, use alcohol to deal with the work stress and work has been stupid stressful this year. I’m also a very social drinker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So here’s the goal - no more than three alcoholic drinks per week for the next five weeks before Augusta IRONMAN 70.3.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now I need your help. Hold me accountable. If you’re with me, tell me not to drink. Ride my ass. Make fun of me. Encourage me. I’m especially talking to my work colleagues. We have plenty of time to drink together but for now I have to get my body in the best shape possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I’ve said before, accomplishing big goals brings Positive Vibes and I’m all about those vibes man.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So how about you? What are some big goals you can state publicly? How can I, we or the entire world hold you accountable?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t be afraid to admit your failures. Your failures are much more likely to become successes when you state them publicly to the world. Then we can all share and spread badass Positive Vibes to everyone around us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m wishing you a weekend full of Positive Vibes!</p>

<p>Your Monday Positive Vibes</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“My only enemy is me and even I can’t stop me.” - Andy Mineo</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s all about me. Seriously. Can't you tell from this picture?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m actively trying to drill this into my head. Sounds pretty selfish, right? It’s not what you think.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How is Ma Bell riding?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was Middle School’s marathon time in NYC?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How many clients do my competitors have?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What’s Revelry Brewing doing this weekend?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My biggest single flaw is my obsession with what everyone else is doing. You could call it jealousy. Maybe envy. It’s one of those deadly sins. I guess the 10 Commandments calls it coveting.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Except it’s not a material thing. I’m not a materialistic person at all. I don't care what other people have. It’s more of a success thing. I want others to absolutely crush it. They motivate me to do more. Competition is good for everyone. But then I get jealous and it often becomes an obsession. I concentrate more on them than I do me. I obsessively compare myself to everyone around me.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coach Chris is really hammering this into my soul. He gets so sick of hearing me talk about other everyone else’s times. Stop comparing myself to others. Only compare myself to myself.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn’t start any of this to be better than anyone else. I started doing all this because I want to be better than me. Every single day I want to wake up better than yesterday’s version of me. I want Monday’s Wesley to be better than Sunday’s Wesley.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Middle School’s marathon time doesn’t matter. The only time that matters is my previous time and the only goal that matters is a PR (personal record). The only person I’m trying to beat is Wesley. As rapper Andy Mineo says “my only enemy is me and even I can’t stop me.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Comparing yourself to anyone else is only going to create jealousy and envy and those do absolutely nothing but build negative vibes. Flip that on it’s head by only comparing yourself to yourself. The only thing that really matters is that you are becoming a better version of yourself. And that brings all the Positive Vibes in the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope your Monday and your week is totally full of Positive Vibes.</p>

<p>Your Tuesday Positive Vibes&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Life feels like a giant game of Jenga. You’re moving around pieces and just trying to keep the damn thing together so that the world doesn’t fall down.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For me, that creates mountains of stress, a fear of action and loads of negative vibes. But then I ask myself “what’s the worst that can happen here?” As long as my family remains healthy who cares if the blocks fall?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve been there before. Multiple times. I thought it was all over. The world was ending. It turns out that the world kept going and all I had to do was start stacking those blocks again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Worrying about failure creates stagnation and negative vibes. You’re going to fail if you do anything worth doing. Don’t fear it. Embrace it. Know it’s coming. And know that you can just start over if those blocks fall. That’s how you bring all the Positive Vibes to your daily life.</p>

<p>Your Wednesday Positive Vibes</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m hopping from meeting to meeting in Atlanta today, so I don't have a lot of time to write. I did want to get one point out today, because I’m dealing with something, and it’s on my mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The harder you work and the higher you build your castle, there will always be someone jealous of your successes who will try to kick your castle down, rather than put in the hard work to build their own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not right, not cool and certainly not fair - but this world isn’t right, cool or fair. It’s full of assholes who would rather spread negativity than see everyone do well and be filled with positive vibes. They attack, they spread drama, they even create fiction just to get attention. I know... I used to be that guy. Luckily, I changed years ago. Too many haven’t.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>None of that means they have to win. They may give you a headache. They may even set you back a few days, weeks or months. But you will always win, because you are a builder. And a builder knows that in every scenario, they will face an obstacle. In knowing, a builder can be ready for anything. They become stronger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius said, “The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Use the ones coming after you as fuel to work harder, faster and smarter. They may try to fill you with negativity, but in the end, they're just fueling your Positive Vibes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope your Wednesday is awesome!</p>

7741,"Wu-Tang Is For The Children","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm back on it. Here's your Monday Positive Vibes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m not black… in case you haven’t noticed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve never dealt drugs. I’ve never been to prison. I sure as hell can’t rap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in a lot of ways being poor, hungry and borderline homeless transcends race. Yes, I may have “ white privilege.” That doesn’t mean I haven’t been thrown on the ground and held at gunpoint by police officers. It doesn’t mean I haven’t been jumped and left to cry in a pool of my own blood. It doesn’t mean I haven’t seen my own mother’s teeth knocked out of her head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the last few days I’ve been watching both the Showtime documentary and the new Hulu show about the Wu-Tang Clan and outside of the drug dealing, prison and rapping, I am reminded so much of my childhood. So much of the daily lifestyle is the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The thing is though - I don’t have to be reminded. I dwell on it every single day. That’s what pushes me to keep moving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think about being sent to my neighbors to ask for food because we were so hungry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We ate cereal for nearly every meal. It was the cheapest thing we could get with our food stamps. We always ran out of milk and had to use water instead, probably because a lot of those food stamps were being traded for pills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We sat in front of the TV all day because Mom thought it was too unsafe for us to play outside around our Section 8 housing. In case you’re wondering, that’s why I’m just now learning to swim.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mom couldn’t afford a babysitter while she went to cosmetology school so at nine-years-old I was babysitting my little sister. I’m pretty sure that shits illegal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think of the violence. So much violence. So many black and blue faces. So much blood. That shotgun stuck in my mother’s mouth. It’s there every time I close my eyes, even when I blink. It never leaves. Those are stories for another time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This weekend Elizabeth and I decided to take the family to an Italian restaurant. My five-year-old said “I don’t want Italian.” He’s a great kid. He was just being a five-year-old. I looked at Elizabeth and said “I can’t believe I’m in a place in my life where my kid can turn up his nose at amazing Italian. I’ll never forget my first time eating McDonalds and thinking we were rich.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And that’s the point of the Wu-Tang documentary and show - a bunch of poor guys who came from the absolute worst, who worked their asses off and are now able to live lives completely opposite of where they were. As Method Man said, “I’m just happy my kids don’t have to grow up the way I did.” Amen, Meth. Amen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I discovered the Wu-Tang Clan in high school and their lyrics hit me slap in the face. I heard where they came from and then saw where they were. I told myself that if they could do it, I could too. Aside from color, the big city of New York and my non-existent ability to rap, we weren’t all that different.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If anything, I hope I can be like them and serve as a small example that you can change your life around. I never thought I would travel the world, own a business, live where I’m living, become an IRONMAN or have the family I have.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I never thought I would until I told myself that I would. Once I made that mental flip it was all over. Some people run toward success. I don’t. I run away from poverty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m not special. I’m not good looking. I’m not a genius. I’m not fast or strong. I just work harder than everyone else. You can do that too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And never forget - Wu-Tang is for the children.</p>

7751,"Rise To The Occasion","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your Daily Positive Vibes: How I Channel 9/11 Every Single Day</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few years ago I read a sales book in which the author recommended creating a “trigger” to put himself in go-mode. Since then I’ve heard it recommended by numerous folks - endurance athletes and entrepreneurs alike. Jesse Itzler calls it a “start switch” He writes that it’s “a ritual that sends a signal to your brain that it’s time to rise to the occasion.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have a trigger that I use multiple times every day - before training, before a race, before an important call, before a big business pitch. My trigger tells me that it’s time to flip the switch from being laid back Wesley to full on beast mode Wesley.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought long and hard about what I could use as my trigger. My thoughts kept coming back to Todd Beamer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Todd Beamer wasn’t some stud. He was just a normal dude like me who went beast mode and did something extraordinary. When I think of “rise to the occasion” Todd Beamer is always the first name that pops in my head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Todd passed away on September 11, 2001. He was a passenger on United Flight 93. He was a husband, and the father of two sons - a three-year-old and a one-year - and an unborn daughter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Todd wasn’t just a badass. He was a hero who helped save this nation from further disaster. No one knows exactly where Flight 93 was heading but al Qaeda detainees have claimed it was heading for either the White House or the United States Capital. It didn’t reach those destinations because Todd and others decided to fight back. They stormed the airplane cockpit. The plane lost control and crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania killing Todd, thirty-nine other passengers and crew and the four terrorists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The last words heard on the flight recorder where from Todd saying “let’s roll” right before storming the cockpit. I obviously didn’t know Todd but as a father of three I know exactly what he was thinking when those words came out of his mouth. I hope his children know that not every man rises to the occasion. It takes a special breed and he was of that breed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it’s time for me to rise to the occasion I close my eyes, I take a deep breathe and I say out loud “let’s roll.” Todd Beamer is my trigger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today I pray for Todd Beamer’s family, all the victims of 9/11 and all the men and women who rose to the occasion and ran toward danger to help their neighbors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope you all have an amazing Wednesday full of Positive Vibes.</p>

7756,"Simplify your life to crush life","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did you know that the D-Day invasion was drafted on a single piece of paper?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s true. Here it is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":7757,""align"":""center""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter""><img src=""https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image1.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-7757""/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bruce Lee once said “the successful warrior is the average man, with laser-like focus.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Henry David Thoreau wrote “our life is frittered away by detail... Simplify, simplify, simplify! I say, let your affairs has as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million, count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumbnail.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We live in a new age where we are being bombarded by information from all angles. We focus on nothing. Alerts are buzzing at all times. We watch TV with one and sometimes multiple devices in our hands. Hell, we don’t even focus on the road while we are driving, instead looking down at our cell phones.. Too many apps. Too many texts. Too many emails. Too many stories. Too many choices. How many times have you just stared at a menu, a grocery store shelf or even your refrigerator?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not just every specific moment. Look big picture and you’ll find that your days, your months and even your years are unfocused. Instead of tackling a couple huge goals we focus on three hundred items that distract us from doing anything meaningful in our lives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve taken a different path in 2019. I’m focusing on five items and five items only. I’ve told you that before. These are in no particular order, for those of you who criticized me earlier for not having God first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li>Empire - Growing my businesses and personal wealth.</li><li>Family - Keeping them healthy, smiling and focused on personal growth.</li><li>Fitness - Getting faster and growing endurance.</li><li>God - Growing my relationship with Jesus Christ.</li><li>Peace - Finding mental peace, relaxation and clarity.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each one of those five is simplified even more with three questions each. Let’s take Fitness as an example:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {""ordered"":true} -->
<ol><li>Does this get me faster?</li><li>Does this help me go longer?</li><li>Does this allow me to do this when I’m 60?</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the answer is No, then it is either eliminated or delegated to someone else. Obviously when it comes to fitness, delegation isn’t something I can do. That is typically for business items when I ask the question - can anyone else in my office do this?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s take heavy weight lifting for example. Benching a bunch of iron may make me look better and boost my ego. It doesn’t, however, help me get faster, grow my endurance or help me do this when I’m 60. If anything, it does just the opposite. The bigger I am, the heavier I am and the slower I get. Therefore, I have eliminated heavy weight lifting this year and instead I’m focusing on more body weight exercises.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last week I met with a company that I’m mentoring. The CEO bombarded me with twenty issues he’s dealing with. I told him to trash the list and worry about one thing and one thing only for the next month - sign up five companies for his services. That’s it!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I started 2019 by creating my focus list. Then I just started simplifying everything in my life. I started small by deleting a bunch of apps from my phone. I cleaned out my closet and donated a bunch to Goodwill. I moved on to my schedule and wouldn’t let a thing get on it that wasn’t based on my focus list. I created three questions for everything on my focus list. I learned to say NO a whole bunch. Now I’m moving on to the hardest thing of all - not getting into stupid political fights on social media =)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2019 is all about uncluttering my life to gain focus and clarity. It’s all about simplicity. Then and only then can I crush life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the great philosopher Princess Elsa once said “let it go.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I ask you today as I’ve asked you in the past - what can you let go from your life today?</p>

<p>Your (no so daily anymore) Positive Vibes:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, ""Woman, here is your son,"" and to the disciple, ""Here is your mother."" From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John 19: 25 - 27</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jesus hung from a cross in unimaginable pain only minutes from his death. Yet he wasn’t thinking about himself. He was thinking about his friends and family and their pain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I use His example every time I’m going through a rough time and I find that in helping others I start to feel better. Now don’t get me wrong, I am not comparing anything I’ve ever gone through to a crucifixion. Still, I think the selfless love of Jesus Christ doesn’t just help those we love. It helps us too. Perhaps selfless love can actually help one’s self, which goes against the very definition of the word. In helping others we help ourselves. We take our mind off our own pain and in doing so we can make it through our pain to the other side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Give it a try. Next time you’re having a rough day, the next time you’re in pain or the next time you’re in the middle of an all out suckfest, go tell someone how much you love them and see if you can help them through the suckfest they’re facing. I bet it helps you both.</p>

7839,"How I’ll Read 50 Books In 2020","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last week I told a friend that I read 32 books in 2019 and that I’m planning on tackling 50 in 2020. She rightfully asked “how are you able to read so much?” I thought the answer to that question could be helpful to you also.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I read four books at a time.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I get bored easily and one book rarely keeps my attention like a good Netflix binge. I allow myself to skip back and forth between serious and fun content. My book choices usually fall into the following categories;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Business (Getting Things Done)</li><li>Fun (Star Trek Discovery: The Enterprise Wars)</li><li>Training (The TB 12 Method),</li><li>And long, which brings me time my next point...</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I&nbsp;break up really long or very substantive books by reading just one chapter per day.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think about how folks read the Bible. Most plans suggest a few Old Testament, New Testament, and Psalms per day. This technique keeps readers from getting overwhelmed or bored, and most importantly, allows them to meditate on a few key points throughout the day. Currently I’m reading 48 Laws Of Power by Robert Greene, which is 482 pages long and those pages are single spaced and compact. I’m reading just one law each day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I both read and listen to each book.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For every book I read I purchase the hard copy and Audible version. Audible is amazing. I listen to books on my commutes to work and on long runs. Quick tip, try listening at 1.5x or 2x the normal speeds. Then I go back and highlight important parts in the hard copy as soon as I arrive at my destination. I read the hard copies over morning coffee, at work, and in bed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I use the Blinkist app.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recommended to me by a friend to replace books, I use it differently. I use the app to help summarize books and to go back and help me remember what a book was about. My brain only has so much memory capacity and it’s impossible to remember everything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hope those tips help you knock out more reading in 2020.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Have a great day full of Positive Vibes.</p>

7848,"7 Books I’ve Read In 2020","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last week, I told a friend that I read 32 books in 2019 and that I’m planning on tackling 50 in 2020. She rightfully asked “how are you able to read so much?” I thought the answer to that question could be helpful to you also.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have a big goal of reading 50 books in 2020. How? Well you can <a href=""https://wesleydonehue.com/how-ill-read-50-books-in-2020/"">click here</a> to read my strategy. Here are the first seven I read and my recommendation on whether or not you should take the time to check them out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""customFontSize"":23} -->
<p style=""font-size:23px""><strong>1.<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/10X-Rule-Difference-Between-Success/dp/0470627603"">The 10X Rule: The Only Difference Between Success and Failure by Grant Cardone</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""align"":""left""} -->
<p class=""has-text-align-left"">This is a great motivational book to start the year off with energy and inspiration. I have been both reading and listening to this one. Cardone’s conversational style in the audiobook is really great. Read this one if you’re looking at taking your life to the next level with 10x effort and 10x results. I highly recommend but only if you are willing to work your face off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""customFontSize"":23} -->
<p style=""font-size:23px""><strong>2. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Way-Wolf-Straight-Persuasion-Influence/dp/1501164287"">Way of the Wolf: Straight Line Selling: Master the Art of Persuasion Influence, and Success by Jordan Belfort</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After picking this book up at least 25 times, I finally finished it last night. I didn’t like this one at all and would not recommend it. I picked it up after the recommendation of a work colleague and lets be real... who doesn’t think Jordan Belfort, also known as The Wolf of Wall Street, was a total baller?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now lets be even more real. If you saw the movie then you know that when the guy did have money he was a straight scum bag and he got all that money by scamming people. Then he lost it all and decided to hack his method through this book. Well, I can’t trust a method that was built on scamming people. Does his sales method really work for legit services and products? It’s tough to say but what’s not tough to say is that today he’s $100 Million in debt. Then, not only did he get busted and go to jail, but he lightened his prison sentence by ratting out all the people he employed and taught.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This guy is human garbage and I regret giving him even a few bucks by purchasing this book. Don’t read it.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""customFontSize"":23} -->
<p style=""font-size:23px""><strong>3. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Keep-Simple-Unclutter-Your-Uncomplicate/dp/1608105849"">Keep It Simple: Unclutter Your Mind to Uncomplicate Your Life</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I picked up this little toilet read in the airport a few months back and finally knocked it out yesterday. “Toilet read” is what I call little books that you can take down in a couple sittings. ?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This one is cute. It’s a mix of short writings and graphics to get across one point - just simplify your life. Simplify your belongings , your schedule and even your friends. Use the KISS model and Keep It Simple Stupid. I started implementing this, mostly with my belongings and my business ventures a few months back. As one close business confident told me last year “shed which does not serve you.” I’ve been trying to live that.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I liked this little toilet read. It has a great message.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""customFontSize"":23} -->
<p style=""font-size:23px""><strong>4. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Mastermind-Drugs-Empire-Murder-Betrayal/dp/0399590412"">The Mastermind: Drugs. Empire. Murder. Betrayal. by Evan Ratliff</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Holy crap this book is awesome! The Mastermind is the true story of Paul La Roux, a geek computer programmer turned international drug kingpin. He founded, built and ran a digital pill mill, delivering illegal prescription pills around the world and helping to fuel America’s opioid epidemic. This is the story of how he did it, how he became a cruel murderer and how he was caught. It’s full of strange stories, like how he tried to create an army of children. He would knock up and pay prostitutes in different countries because most countries won’t extradite the father of citizens. ?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sidenote: since this book was released there is now mounting evidence that La Roux is Satoshi Nakamoto, the made up name of the bitcoin creator.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I loved this book and couldn’t stop reading over four days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""customFontSize"":23} -->
<p style=""font-size:23px""><strong>5. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building-ebook/dp/B00DQ845EA"">The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers by Ben Horowitz</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I enjoyed this one enough to knock it out in two days. I needed this book after the last two years of dealing with what seems like nothing but hard things. Every time I fixed a hard thing another hard thing popped up. Client issues, financial issues, employee issues, other issues. It was just one thing after the other for twenty-four months. Finally I think we are back on track in every respect and the future looks brighter than ever for Push Digital. I just wish I would have read this one earlier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Horowitz lays out some great advice for dealing with hard things. And lets be real for a minute... yes, I think we are back on track but the hard things will NEVER end. That’s just business. It’s not just at Push Digital. Every single business has the same drama. And really, that’s just life too. As the saying goes “if it were easy everyone would be doing it.” That’s why I pride myself in taking on hard things. I want to be known as the guy who can handle hard things. I can embrace the suck.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This book will not just be a one time read. It will be a daily reference for both big and small decisions. I’ll keep it on my desk at all times. Topics include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>hiring</li><li>firing</li><li>raises</li><li>job titles</li><li>communication</li><li>performance reviews</li><li>office politics</li><li>the role of the CEO</li><li>and much more.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I really liked this book a lot, but let me be clear - this is a business book. I would not suggest for those who aren’t in some sort of leadership role.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""customFontSize"":23} -->
<p style=""font-size:23px""><strong>6. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197"">The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lot of characters were fighting for power in Game of Thrones. Most of them did it through military strategy and brute strength. But one of them climbed the status ladder by being sneaky and playing conniving games. This book could be the foundation for the Little Finger character.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I finally finished The 48 Laws of Power today after nearly two years. I kept picking it up and putting it down for many reasons. First, it’s huge and dense. The author gets way too bogged down with stories and examples in an attempt to prove his points with historical references, most of which come from French history. He does, but it’s a bit too much. More importantly, I kept finding myself annoyed because the book could have been titled “How To Be An Asshole.” I just think there are better ways to gain power, like pure hustle and results. This book explains the easy way. And it’s the evil way in many cases. The strategies are great but the intentions are awful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What I found is that I won’t use a lot of these strategies for myself but this book helped me see when others are using them on me or on the public. It also helped me understand politics even better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At times I loved this book because it has phenomenal content. At times I hated it because it made me hate humanity and see a lot of conspiracies. I got paranoid, but as my friend and mentor <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100005656454709&amp;__tn__=K-R&amp;eid=ARCzWrOr1tIqKeE1dKlShez5_4gDFD3BLuJxGojpaSySQ3XW1-T8BdtbWRJwBTzcdNPbpwQkVOuGQVsI&amp;fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDRkKHlks73qX8GOBKJHx8FZArtGO8-0F4XA_XvQThtXVA47oZ1MG6U3zNbl9LBzZDnEjCqCZ_TP523Wok3EAlSgv-m8BzUOLypOVOrYNlwkaG_Flw2VU4rdfMvKzsSBlcNnY6MeloEkGknVBQ7DtIfoU68SqtXAkcEQMVC1vbO-K4lP7dH2UGhkAYCJlS9mTQB0Ejb8UgepXloh7scMauVj-HdnZOSbp49ym96EJ0b6dBjmzLY84p_p5WhdOyeBIQC6Q"">Harvey Peeler</a> says ""you're not paranoid if they really are out to get you."" I recommend but with caution. Don’t be this person.</p>

<p style=""font-size:23px""><strong>7. <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280"">The E Myth Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don’t Work and What to Do About it by Michael E. Gerber</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This book should be required reading for entrepreneurs. I read it about five years ago but forgot much of it. A lot of early Push was based on this book and after reading it again I will be moving back toward this business philosophy. In fact, I may make myself read it quarterly just so that I don’t get off of it. That’s how much I believe in this book.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a business book and not worth the time for anyone not running a company. If you are a business owner looking to scale your company, you would be dumb not to read this book.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Stay tuned for the next round of book reviews as I continue my challenge to read 50 books in 2020. </p>

<p>My journey to knock out fifty books is outpacing my original plan. I’ve already finished ten in the first twenty-four days of January. Full disclosure: some of these were started in December 2019 and I finished them in early January.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I just finished three more this week, one I recommend to everyone, one I recommend to my fellow endurance junkies and one I recommend to anyone leading a business or organization. I hope you find this list useful.</p>

<h2><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/TB12-Method-Lifetime-Sustained-Performance/dp/1501180738/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+tb+method&amp;qid=1581016445&amp;sr=8-1"">The TB Method</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may hate the New England Patriots and Tom Brady. If you do, it’s probably because Tom Brady is the winningest quarterback in history. That’s in large part because he’s been able to sustain a healthy career far beyond most NFL players. I’m not an NFL fan so I don’t like or dislike Tom Brady. However, there is absolutely no denying his ability to sustain peak performance into what would be considered late years in professional football. Therefore his words should be listened&nbsp;to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Really, I loved this book and will be incorporating much of it into my training and daily life. I 100% buy into his philosophy of keeping the body healthy for life so that we can continue being active for a long time. I, for one, want to be competing in endurance events well into my seventies. This is something my coaches at Endurance Farm have been drilling into my head and Tom Brady confirms many of their points regarding holistic training.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The TB12 Method is based on 12 principles:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. Pliability - the daily lengthening and softening of muscles before and after workouts<br>2. Holistic and integrative training<br>3. Balance and moderation in all things<br>4. Conditioning for endurance and vitality<br>5. No-load training<br>6. Promote anti-inflammatory responses in the body<br>7. Promote oxygen-rich blood flow<br>8. Proper hydration<br>9. Healthy nutrition<br>10. Supplementation<br>11. Brain exercises<br>12. Brain rest, recentering and recovery</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I finished this book today but it will stay in my gym as a reference that I’ll view daily. There are some things I won’t incorporate like his overly extreme diet, but he even admits that he’s only doing so because fitness is his job. It’s not mine. It’s my hobby. Still, holistic training is the route my coaches have been taking me and it’s one that I accept fully.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I recommend this book to anyone who wants to stay active for decades.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>TOTALLY LIFE CHANGING</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rarely do I say that something is life-changing. I must in this case because it will literally change how I address sleep and in turn, my health, my training, my intelligence, and my family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I started reading the hard copy of this book two days ago and haven’t been able to put it down. Thanks to two hours of training and five hours of housework today I was able to quickly crush this book with Audible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is said that the three pillars of health are sleep, diet, and exercise. The author argues that the pillars are diet and exercise and sleep is actually the foundation. After reading his argument, I totally agree.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I will be changing how much I drink and when I drink. When and how I go to bed. When and how I wake up. How much computer work or tv viewing I do before bed. How much water I drink and when I drink it. And even how I raise my children.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was particularly intrigued by the argument that we are killing our children’s development with early school start times. We are especially harming children in low-income areas because they have to wake up sometimes an hour earlier to catch the bus, thus having an hour less to sleep than those students who have parents who drop them off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The author also makes a great argument as to why children must not be on ADHD meds because it keeps them awake at exactly the stage in development that they need sleep the most. Those medications do more harm than good by compounding the problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you read just one book in 2020, make it this book.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Know-What-Youre-Growth-Strategy/dp/0310356318/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=know+what+you%27re+for&amp;qid=1581016684&amp;sr=8-1"">Know What You're For</a></h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What are you for?<br>What is your business for?<br>What’s the whole point of all this effort?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those are the questions Jeff Henderson wants you to answer in “Know What You’re For: A Growth Strategy for Work, An Even Better Strategy Foe Life.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was on the road a lot this week so I was able to knock this book out in just three days mostly through Audible. It was recommended to me by an Atlanta based political consultant, from where Henderson also hails. Henderson uses a lot of examples from his employments at Chic-Fil-A and North Point Ministry to highlight a business’ need to be FOR the customer, instead of always promoting itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I rather enjoyed this one. There are a lot of good reminders that your customers and employees need to know that you’re working for something bigger than money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I recommend this one for leaders of all kind who need a reminder of who they are and what they’re for.</p>

<p>I am continuing along my path to read fifty books in 2020 and I’m way ahead of where I thought I would be. Today I tell you about books eleven, twelve and thirteen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Game-Changers-Leaders-Innovators-Mavericks-ebook/dp/B077XG39QR"">Game Changers: What Leaders, Innovators, and Mavericks Do to Win at Life</a></strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some people are content with who they are. That’s fine. However, some are always striving to be better, always growing. They believe that if they are not growing, they are dying. They are not trying to be better than anyone else. They are trying to be better than they were yesterday. Better spouses and parents. Better leaders and innovators. Faster, stronger, smarter, wiser. Wealthier, more experienced, more traveled. The list goes on and on and the journey never stops.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now take that up one level and there are people who aren’t tying to do those things just through brute force. They work tirelessly but they also look for hacks that can help them get there more efficiently. That’s the category in which I find myself. This is a book for crazies like me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m constantly experimenting. I’m always biohacking, testing new supplements, diets, workouts and other things that generally suck and don’t feel great. I’m always looking for ways to expand my mind, find peace and make better decisions. I want more energy. I want to lead better. I want to love more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I loved this book because it’s full of advice from game changers across industries who are doing extraordinary and uncommon things every single day. That’s the key - doing uncommon things. The way to be uncommon isn’t to occasionally do uncommon things. It’s to do uncommon things all day every single day. It’s about thinking and acting differently than everyone else. That’s what this book is about and it’s exactly what I want to do and what I want to be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Very few books are perfect and this one is no different. Asprey can be all over the map. Parts of the book don’t exactly flow well. I won’t be be doing LSD or enacting some of the uncommon sexual advice. But there’s so much I will be trying.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This book isn’t for everyone. It’s for those who want to be better than they were yesterday by trying uncommon techniques. If that’s you, get this book today.</p>

<p>This one is a little longer than a toilet read. Maybe a three potty read. I’m trying to finish all Ryan Holiday books this month and this is one of his two marketing books, the other being “Trust Me, I’m Lying” which is full of unreal stories of media manipulation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I cannot say I learned a lot of new stuff with this one as most of these strategies I’ve been implementing for years. But I’m different. I’m a media manipulator. I would recommend this book for anyone else in the business, especially those just starting out. I also enjoyed a lot of fun stories about start ups who have hacked the system to blow up their businesses. It’s very short but also very useful to have you thinking in a different way.</p>

<h2><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Tim-Ferriss-Audio-Ego-Enemy/dp/B01GSIZ9EY/ref=sr_1_1?crid=MXJXSLYXG8Q3&amp;keywords=ego+is+the+enemy&amp;qid=1581098574&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=ego+is+%2Cdigital-text%2C149&amp;sr=1-1""><strong>Ego Is the Enemy</strong><br /></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I just finished my third Ryan Holiday book, not including his daily stoic meditations that I’m now reading a second time, and he’s quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. I wish I would have read this one years ago. This should be required reading for every kid coming out of college. I know I’ve employed a couple in recent years that need this book.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So many times it’s our own egos standing in the way of our success. We deserve this. We are owed that. We are too good for the grunt work. We want everything now without putting in the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a reason CS Lewis called pride the worst of all sins. All other sins stem from it. Holiday does a great job explaining why. Thinking you are so great can, and probably will be, your ultimate downfall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I definitely recommend this book. Also check out Ryan Holiday’s <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Obstacle-Way-Timeless-Turning-Triumph/dp/B00K5JUNSU/ref=sr_1_1?crid=25Z0IP4CQNJSZ&amp;keywords=the+obstacle+is+the+way&amp;qid=1581098625&amp;s=audible&amp;sprefix=the+obs%2Caudible%2C166&amp;sr=1-1"">The Obstacle Is The Way</a>.</p>

<p>I am continuing down the path of reading 50 books in 2020. I really loved all three of these. One is for Star Trek fans only. The other two are must reads for everyone. I also have a bonus book for you at the end that I didn’t include in the 50 because it’s so short.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Stillness-Key-Ryan-Holiday/dp/0525538585"">Stillness Is The Key</a> by Ryan Holiday</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You’re a human being. Not a human doing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m not rich but I have more than my parents ever did, more than I thought I would ever have. I have an amazing wife and three adorable boys. I live in a house I always thought was beyond a welfare kid’s grasp. I have multiple successful businesses. Most of all, I have stability. I achieved none of these things through handouts, favors, talent or genius. It all came through extreme hard work. That’s why I tell you my story here. I’m not bragging. I want to be an example because I think, I know, you too are capable of rising from shit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But now I face a new problem - fear. Anyone who has ever risen from shit to have gained something, anything, has a deep fear of losing it all, to falling back into the shit. So the hard work never stops. We throw gasoline on the fire. We go until there is an explosion. We go until we collapse, literally. Until our blood pressure is so high that it’s the hard work itself, what gained it all, that becomes what could lose it all, maybe even life itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This book is the antidote. Holiday lays out in detail what happens to our minds, spirits and bodies when we don’t seek stillness in our lives. He looks at the lives of stoic philosophers, Jesus, Mr Rogers, Ann Frank, Winston Churchill and many others to tell us what we can do right. He gives us tactics to avoid the ever constant interruption of today’s social world. He tells us how to change our lives, something I desperately need to do right now. Be alone, read, sleep, meditate, walk, seek a higher power, find a hobby, just stop moving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you already have a chill mode and you don’t find your blood pressure rising throughout the day, then maybe this book isn’t for you. But if you are like me, this book is exactly what you need at this exact moment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lastly, this book is one of a trilogy from Ryan Holiday which includes “The Obstacle Is The Way” and “Ego Is The Enemy.” I adore all three and highly recommend them to you.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are all going to die. And at some point or another you are practically forced to contemplate your life and question who you are and the meaning in this journey of life, your life.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I came across this book at exactly the right time as I crossed over the forty mark. I’m not having a midlife crisis. I am, however, asking more questions about life than I’ve ever asked. These questions Kabat-Zinn callls “terrifying aspects of the human psyche.” The answers are hard to find in this fast paced world where our attention is pulled in a hundred different directions at any, or every, given moment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This book isn’t just about how to meditate. It’s about slowing down and being in every moment. It’s about giving one thing our attention. Yesterday a client came to town and eight of us sat in a conference room for hours. Typically I would be listening to the meeting while on my laptop and also constantly checking my phone. Yesterday I tried so hard to put the phone and the computer down and just be in the meeting. It was so so hard. And truthfully, I failed. But there was an hour span when I succeeded. I was proud of myself. Now I must build on that hour and spread it across my entire life, most especially when I’m with my family. In recent days I’ve just put my phone in the other room. The constant bombardment of texts can wait.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I can’t say I enjoyed this book. I can say that I desperately needed this book. This one is a game changer for me. It was a wake up call. I don’t know where those last forty years went. It all happened way too fast. I’m going to slow it down so that I can enjoy more individual moments over the next forty years. I recommend this book to everyone.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A mindset so rigidly formed that it cannot be changed is a terrible thing,” Admiral Picard writes in his log almost as if he just viewed Facebook in 2020.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If there were any doubt that Star Trek has become political commentary on today’s world, that doubt can be erased. Since it’s debut, Star Trek has always commented on today’s real world political environment through stories in space with other species. The change is that this entire show, and especially this book, is one big political warning after Donald Trump was elected President and the UK left the EU.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the story of a people who decide to shut themselves off to others and somewhat become isolationists. This is the story of a person who comes to power through populism when politicians ignore flyover states (I mean small worlds) and blue collar workers (I mean farmers and ship builders) and topples the current belief system. And unfortunately this is the story of a beloved legend whose ego gets so big that he runs away disillusioned instead of staying in the fight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe this is a good point in my review to throw out a disclaimer. I am a Republican political consultant. Star Trek has often been my escape from the stress of politics. Now it seems Star Trek is politics. I throw out this disclaimer to say to my conservative friends, do not worry. This book isn’t an attack on conservatives. It lays out the arguments for both sides.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aside from the politics, numerous questions were answered and the backgrounds of new characters were given. We learn why Raffi is so enraged, of Elnor’s background and even what happened to Worf, Geordi, Beverly and Spock. We learn why Picard left the Enterprise, how the dynamics with the Romulans unfolded and what led up to Picard leaving Starfleet. Most important, we learn a lot about the synths, how and why they were built.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I loved this book and could not put it down for two days. It is required reading for anyone watching Star Trek: Picard. It fills in all the gaps beautifully and opens up a can of new theories. Star Trek fans, read this book now.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After purchasing the Wim Hof Method ten week program and three failed attempts at completing it, I’m going back in with full commitment. I love Wim Hof and believe everything he preaches. Unfortunately I’ve been unable to complete his program because my IRONMAN training schedule in 2018 and 2019 kept getting in the way. 2020 will be different. Ten weeks from now I’ll tell you how completing the program feels. For now I’ll just tell you that I feel awesome every time I do his breath techniques and cold water therapy.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to know more and you are a Netflix subscriber (who isn’t?) watch episode 2 of Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop Lap. You can also pick up this book. I finished it again this weekend. It’s more like a long pamphlet. It’s so short that I won’t count it in my #50booksin2020.</p>

7958,"Stoicism, Conspiracies, and Disney World","I am continuing along my path to read fifty books in 2020 and I’m way ahead of where I thought I would be. Today I tell you about books sixteen through twenty.
<h2><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Letters-Penguin-Classics-Lucius-Annaeus/dp/0140442103"">Letters of a Stoic</a>, Seneca</h2>
Aside from The Bible and Mere Christianity, I have no book as dog eared or as marked up with highlights, lines and my own thoughts. I also have no book that I re-read as much or go back to for reference as, like the Bible, it has become vital to the core of who I am, or at least who I want to be.

It is tough to explain this book, written as a series of letters from 63 - 65 AD, to you without going into a full analysis of stoic philosophy, as this book is one of it’s foundations. This is a book about human nature and the best way to live life each day, which I find especially important in a time when none of us relax or enjoy individual moments, constantly interrupted by social media, twenty-four news networks and our phones. We are never disconnected. We are never at true peace.

Instead of giving you a full breakdown of this book, which I find as impossible as the Bible, I will simply give you some of my favorite quotes:

Happy the man who improves other people not merely when he is in their presence but even when he is in their thoughts.

For the only safe harbor in this life’s tossing, troubled sea is to refuse to be bothered about what the future will bring and to stand ready and confident, squaring the breast to take without skulking or flinching whatever fortune hurls at us.

One of the causes of the troubles that beset us is the way our lives are guided by the example of others; instead of being set to rights by reason we're seduced by convention.

True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not.

A good character is the only guarantee of everlasting, carefree happiness.

But when you are looking on anyone as a friend when you do not trust him as you trust yourself, you are making a grave mistake, and have failed to grasp sufficiently the full force of true friendship.

Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor strengthens the body.

Why be concerned about others, come to that, when you’ve outdone your own self? Set yourself a limit which you couldn’t even exceed if you wanted to, and say good-bye at last to those deceptive prizes more precious to those who hope for them than to those who have won them. If there were anything substantial in them they would sooner or later bring a sense of fullness; as it is they simply aggravate the thirst of those who swallow them.

Now there are short and simple exercises which tire the body rapidly, and so save our time; and time is something of which we ought to keep strict account. These exercises are running, brandishing weights, and jumping…But whatever you do, come back quickly from body to mind.

It is not the man who has too little that is poor, but the one who hankers after more.

Supposing they say they are happy, will their own opinions to this effect make them happy? It does not make any difference what a man says; what matters is how he feels, and not how he feels on one particular day but how he feels at all times…Only the wise man is content with what is his. All foolishness suffers the burden of dissatisfaction with itself.

I could go on and on and perhaps just quote this entire book. As I re-read it for about the fifth time I underlined new passages that I didn’t catch before. And thus the beauty of stoicism. It hits you where you are today. I recommend this book to every single person reading this.

The first mistake was outing gay Silicon Valley investor and billionaire Peter Thiel. The second mistake was publishing Hulk Hogan’s sex tape. When a group of people get together in secret to take down another group of people, we call that a conspiracy.

Peter Thiel didn’t let his hatred for Gawker go after he was outed. He assembled a group of strategists and attorneys and then he sat b<span class=""text_exposed_show"">ack and waited for the right opportunity. It took ten years. The opportunity finally came in the form of famed wrestler Hulk Hogan. Hogan’s wife called and said she wanted a divorce. In despair he called his best friend for a shoulder to cry on. His friend gave him more than that. He gave him his wife. The friend said that he and his wife were in an open marriage and that the wife wanted to have sex with Hogan. It happened. Multiple times on multiple days, taped without Hogan’s knowledge. And of course, those tapes were leaked online.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

Hogan wanted to sue Gawker, but he didn’t have the funds. Thiel stepped in and secretly funded Hogan’s case. Hogan himself didn’t even know who the funder was. Everything was secret and Gawker never saw it coming. That’s why Gawker no longer exists. They were sued out of existence.

I’m not spoiling the book for you. This is all common knowledge. This book is the story of the intricate details, the amazing strategy and how it all went down. And this is the story of the aftermath and how it bled over to a presidency.

I picked up this book because I’ve become a huge Ryan Holiday fan and after I picked it up I couldn’t put it down. It’s a real page turner. I recommend this book to anyone interested in conspiracies, men with big egos, drama or just a good ole fashioned story about a balding fat man with sex tapes.

<h2><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Meditations/dp/B004INMVDY/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2OABWMDLX5DL6&amp;keywords=meditations+marcus+aurelius&amp;qid=1585761082&amp;s=audible&amp;sprefix=medi%2Caudible%2C196&amp;sr=1-2"">Meditations</a>, Marcus Aurelius</h2>
Stoicism is vogue. Everyone seems to be talking about it, so I started investigating. First I simply Googled “what is stoicism?”

The answer: the endurance of pain or hardship without the display of feelings and without complaint.

That certainly hooked me. You know why. Endurance of pain and hardship is my thing. It’s who I am to my core. But while that’s what hooked me, it’s not exactly what reeled me in. Stoicism isn’t just about pain. It’s about a whole new perspective on yourself and on the world. And I can honestly say that I haven’t encountered anything since maybe the birth of my first child, that has so fundamentally changed my thought process.

Last year I started reading a bunch of books that were basically summaries and explanations of stoicism. I also started reading Seneca. But I didn’t dive into individual Stoic thinkers like Marcus Aurelius for the simple reason that they are so dense. You cannot breeze through these books. In fact, you can barely read a full page at a time. Reading each line is something you have to think on for an entire day. Perhaps that’s why this book is titled “Meditations.”

Just a few of those meditations:

“At dawn of day, when you dislike being called, have this thought ready: 'I am called to man's labour; why then do I make a difficulty if I am going out to do what I was born to do and what I was brought into the world for? Is it for this that I am fashioned, to lie in bedclothes and keep myself warm?' 'But this is more pleasant.' 'Were you born then to please yourself; in fact for feeling, not for action? Can't you see the plants, the birds, the ants, the spiders, the bees each doing his own work, helping for their part to adjust a world? And then you refuse to do a man's office and don't make haste to do what is according to your own nature.' 'But a man needs rest as well.' I agree, he does, yet Nature assigns limits to rest, as well as to eating and drinking, and you nevertheless go beyond her limits, beyond what is sufficient; in your actions only this is no longer so, there you keep inside what is in your power. The explanation is that you do not love your own self, else surely you would love both your nature and her purpose. But other men who love their own crafts wear themselves out in labours upon them, unwashed and unfed; while you hold your own nature in less honour than the smith his metal work, the dancer his art, the miser his coin, the lover of vainglory his fame. Yet they, when the passion is on them, refuse either to eat or to sleep sooner than refuse to advance the objects they care about, whereas you imagine acts of fellowship to bring a smaller return and to be deserving of less pains.”

“The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.”

“Some things are hurrying into existence and others are hurrying out of it and of that which is coming into existence, part is already extinguished. In this flowing stream then, on which there is no abiding, what is there of things which hurry on by on which a man would set a high price. It would be just as if a man should fall in love with one of the sparrows which fly by but has already passed out of sight.”

“If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.”

""The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.""

“Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart.”

“If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed. It is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed.”

“I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.”

“When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.”

“Keep this thought handy when you feel a fit of rage coming on—it isn’t manly to be enraged. Rather, gentleness and civility are more human, and therefore manlier. A real man doesn’t give way to anger and discontent, and such a person has strength, courage, and endurance—unlike the angry and complaining. The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength.”

“No, you do not have thousands of years to live. Urgency is on you. While you live, while you can, become good.”

I could go on all day. In fact, I could just publish the whole book here. Every line is that important.

This wasn’t a book Marcus Aurelius wrote for the world. These are meditations that he wrote to himself. These are directions from him to him. I’ve taken them as directions to me too.

I cannot possibly recommend this book enough. If taken to heart and meditated on, this book could change the core of who you are. While I am not yet a Stoic and certainly not an Emperor or a philosopher, I will be diving deeper into these teachings throughout the year in an attempt to become a better and happier man.

You’ve probably noticed that I’ve slowed down on my book reviews. This one really bogged me down and took what I felt like was forever to finish.

This is an exhaustive biography of one of the world’s best known entrepreneurs. I’ll go one step further and say that from name recognition alone, Walt Disney is historically the world’s best known entrepreneur. Even a two year old in China knows the name. What most people do not know is the entrepreneurial journey behind the name s<span class=""text_exposed_show"">o prominently featured on parks, movies, shows, merchandise and what seems like everything else in the world these days.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

Mostly, what people do not know about are all the total failures Disney had on his way to success. I certainly did not and it was refreshing to to read. We just assume that geniuses like Disney had it so easy on their path to greatness. This book tells the story of a man who failed to success through brute persistence and extreme work hard. Even the things we all think were successes were total failures. Dumbo, Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty, Fantasia and so much more nearly put Disney into bankruptcy over and over. Then through pure luck he would stumble on an idea like merchandising, Cinderella, Davy Crockett and especially Disneyland that saved him from absolute devastation.

That’s a refreshing story for entrepreneurs like me. One day we think we are taking over the world. The next day we think we are going out of business. There’s never an in-between. The bipolar cycle repeats itself over and over and over again, and it’s through persistence and hard work that we keep our operations together with our fingertips. Walt Disney’s is the story of every entrepreneur. He just happened to have more creativity, the ability to see the future and a bit more luck that led him to eternal fame. More than that though, he dreamed big and risked bigger.

This was a long biography and like every long biography I’ve ever read, there were parts that didn’t keep my attention. There were many more parts where I could not put the book down. Gabler obviously spent years doing research to write this book and it paid off to show the complete view of such a fascinating figure who built a global phenomenon many times over. I really enjoyed this one and recommend it to everyone.

WOW! That’s 20 books in 2020. Only thirty more to hit the big goal! I hope you guys are finding something useful in these short reviews.

I really enjoyed this book. So much so that I knocked it out in just twenty-four hours. After reading about the beginnings of the Disney company in Walt Disney’s biography, I wanted to read about Disney today, which became an unstoppable behemoth under Bob Iger’s leadership. When Iger took over Disney was in complete disarray. Now it owns j<span class=""text_exposed_show"">ust about everything I love. All it needs now is Star Trek.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

Bob Iger is the man. He led the acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and Fox. He fathered Baby Yoda... I mean sorta. He literally led Disney into the future by cannibalizing the company’s own business model and being the first to go on iTunes, embracing streaming for ESPN and then launching Disney+ a few months before his retirement. Dude wasn’t at all scared to take a risk. What I love most about Iger was his obsession with the intersection of creative and technology.

I just loved this entrepreneurial story but this isn’t a book for just entrepreneurs. I recommend to all the Disney fans.

I am continuing along my path to read fifty books in 2020 and I’m way ahead of where I thought I would be. Read on to learn about books twenty-one through twenty-four.
<h2><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Run-Mile-Youre-Finding-Every/dp/B07JCJX969/ref=sr_1_1?crid=19PA3NG7BRBUH&amp;keywords=run+the+mile+you%27re+in&amp;qid=1585762026&amp;s=audible&amp;sprefix=run+the+mile+you%2Caudible%2C183&amp;sr=1-1"">Run the Mile You're In</a>, Ryan Hall</h2>
I’m healthy for the first time in 2020. I missed a planned marathon last weekend due to over two months of no running. Now it’s go time. Hard training starts NOW. Just one problem... I don’t feel like it. Like at all. My head isn’t in the right place. I’ve lost a lot of my fitness. I have to start all over.

I needed a read to get me back in the zone. After pulling for his wife, Sarah, in last week’s Olympic trials, I decided to give Ryan Hall’s book a try. Ryan is the Americ<span class=""text_exposed_show"">an record holder for the half marathon with a 59:43. He is also the only American to break the 2:05 full marathon mark. That’s flying!</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

Ryan is a devout Christian which makes this book as much a religious read as a running book. No, I take that back. This is definitely a Christian book disguised as a running book. The book is broken down into twenty-six chapters, one for each mile of the marathon, with twenty-six different lessons and corresponding Bible teachings.

This is a simple read with a good story. It’s not some literary masterpiece but it is what I needed to read with my current mindset. I recommend to all my Christian running buddies.

<h2><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/s?k=living+with+the+monks&amp;i=audible&amp;crid=3O6UVFEBS8FZ1&amp;sprefix=living+w%2Caudible%2C188&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_2_8"">Living with the Monks</a>, Jesse Itzler</h2>
I am a big fan of Jesse Itzler. We have a lot in common. We’re both entrepreneurs who spend our time beating the hell out of our bodies. We both have some ghetto in our backgrounds. I read his first book and even took one of his online courses. I loved them both. Ladies, you may know Itzler best as the husband of SPANX founder, Sara Blakely.

Itzler’s first book, Living With A Seal, told the story of when David Goggins, a former NAVY Seal and ultra-marathoner, moved into his<span class=""text_exposed_show""> house and put him through 31 days of ass kickings. The book was amazing and really funny. It’s a real page turner that I could not put down. At the time, Itzler just called Goggins “Seal” to hide his identity. But it’s not easy to hide a former Seal who is African American, an ultra-marathoner and who just so happens to have the world record for pull-ups. There’s only one person on Earth that badass. Introducing me to Goggins, who has since released his own book, Can’t Stop Me, was a game changer. I’m not going to spend a bunch of time here going into Goggins. You probably know who he is. If you don’t, go on YouTube right now. You’re welcome.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

All to say, Itzler’s first book was really great for me so I had high hopes going into this book, where he tells the story of living with monks. It’s definitely a message I need right now. It does fall in line with a lot of the stoicism I’m currently studying. However, this book was a bit disappointing.

For starters, Itzler moved in with the monks for two weeks. That’s hardly enough time to even warrant a book. Here it seems like he just did the bare minimum to be able to write a book. If you’re going to write a book about it, do something freaking epic. He did that by having Goggins beat the hell out of him for a month. This on the other hand just seemed lazy, something Itzler is definitely not at all.

Itzler learned a lot, mostly about disconnecting and slowing down in this high paced digital world, but that’s not life changing. He could have learned the same from just “social distancing” and turning off his phone. Most relevant for me was this idea of being fully present in what you’re doing, which I wrote about a few weeks back in my review of “Wherever You Go There You Are.”

Once again I enjoyed Itzler’s story telling, but this book was a let down for me. Unplug and be present. There, I saved you from having to read this one. In spite of my take on this book, I’m still a big fan of Jesse Itzler and I will definitely invest in future courses and books.

Warning: Heavy Star Wars Episode 9 Spoilers!

There are certainly things I didn’t like in The Rise of Skywalker. They shouldn’t have brought Palpatine back. They did nothing in the previous two films to establish him as this trilogy’s villain and then they just drop it in the opening crawl. They should have kept Rey as the child of no one special. The whole “surprise! I’m your relative” thing was already done in the biggest twist in movie history. Besides, the whole idea that a<span class=""text_exposed_show"">nyone could be a Jedi was the entire reason for Episode 8’s broom boy ending. Mostly what annoyed me was that it was as if no one got JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson on the same page. One single person should have had control of the story, like Kevin Feige has with Marvel.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

Still... I tried to ignore that for one simple reason - I believe people are too judgmental of movies when they should just enjoy a two (or three) hour escape from reality. Movie critics are the worst!

Now, with all that said, there is one huge issue with The Rise of Skywalker that Abrams could not fix. It was just out of his control. Episode 7 was Han’s story. Episode 8 was Luke’s story. Episode 9 was supposed to be Leias. Unfortunately Carrie Fisher died leaving Abrams with old footage from the previous two movies to work with. As a result, we didn’t get Leias final sorry as we should have. That’s why Star Wars fans should read this book.

It’s not a ton, but this book fills in the gaps that we missed in the movie. There’s more detail about her Jedi training, her relationship with Rey and her conversations with Luke prior to her death. All of those are important to understand Leia’s full journey.

There are other details that you may have read reported online. We get to see how Palpatine came back and we learn more about Rey’s father. All that is cool but what’s truly important is the added Leia content.

I’m not saying that everyone should run out and grab this book but all Star Wars nerds definitely should.

I’m a Republican political consultant but I’m no fan of conservative mouthpieces. I don’t listen to Rush or Hannity. I never listened to O’Reilly. For the love of God I don’t listen to Ann Coulter.

I prefer to think for myself. I base my opinions on logic rather than emotion. That’s why my one exception to the rule is Ben Shapiro. Sure, Shapiro has said a few inflammatory things. That’s always going to happen when one talks for a living. Still, I find Shapiro to be a well st<span class=""text_exposed_show"">udied, intelligent and logical conservative.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

In “The Right Side of History” Shapiro makes the argument that Americans are starting to forget what makes this nation so great. In this case, it’s our foundation of Judeo-Christian values which are being supplanted by secularism and materialism. America has lost any kind of purpose that tied us all together which only leaves complete individualism.

During this crisis everyone from politicians to celebrities are screaming “we are all in this together” but for the decades following WWII we haven’t been in much together at all. Our actions are selfish, fueled by ideas of liberal individualism. This liberalism is destructive to both self and society. As we lose any kind of purpose based on spiritualism we begin focusing solely on materialism.

He writes: “America is struggling right now and a lot of ways. But it’s the largest struggle is the struggle for our national soul. We are so angry at each other right now. That anger is palpable. Where did it come from? It came from the destruction of a common vision. We used to believe in the founding vision, supported by a framework of personal virtue called from Judeo-Christian morality. We used to see each other as brothers and sisters, not the “1% versus the 99%” or “the privileged versus the victims.” We weren’t enemies. We were a community, forged in fire and tethered together by set of values stretching back to the Garden of Eden – a community of individuals working to understand the value of each other as images of God, a community of individuals who believed in our own capacity to change ourselves and the world around us.”

I liked this book. I really enjoy Shapiro’s deep knowledge of history. I really have only one problem with this book. He spends a couple hundred pages explaining the problem and how we’ve seen this same recurrence throughout human history, but he only spends a few pages describing a solution.

As I read this book in the midst of a national crisis I could not help but wonder if, like WWII or 9/11, some good might come of all this. Perhaps this crisis will teach us how to be nation of brothers and sisters who work together for a common purpose. Perhaps I dream too big.

7967,"How To Be Like The Romans and Greeks","<h3>These are two books that I really loved. One is about how to perform best physically by living like the residents of the Greek island of Crete. The other is how to perform best mentally by thinking like Roman Emperor Maximus Aurelius.</h3>
&nbsp;
<h2><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Born-Heroes-Mastering-Endurance-ebook/dp/B00NRQI5U6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NP8AJ6CQQLAX&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=natural+born+heroes&amp;qid=1587062741&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=natural+bor%2Cstripbooks%2C184&amp;sr=1-1"">Natural Born Heroes</a>, Christopher McDougall</h2>
Is running natural to every human and have we actually done ourselves a disservice with “innovations” such as shoes and sports drinks? That’s the question Christopher McDougall tries to answer in “Born To Run,” the story of the world’s best ultra runners who travel to the hidden canyons of Mexico to race the tarahumara Indians. It’s one of my top five all time favorite books and I try to read it at least once every year. If you’re a runner, you need to read “Born To Run.”

Thi<span class=""text_exposed_show"">s time McDougall tackles a similar but different question - have we humans done ourselves a disservice by concentrating on appearance and convenience rather than true strength and endurance? Have we harmed ourselves in gyms with weights and fancy machines rather than focusing on natural movements? He answers the question by traveling to the Greek island of Crete where he explores the story of how untrained natives fought off the Nazis in WWII. Mixed in between chapters are modern day stories of ultra runners, triathletes, obstacle course racers, doctors and dietitians. I especially enjoyed the story of a coach who wants to create a huge outdoor playground for adults. He reminded me of my coach, Chris, at Endurance Farm.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

While I really enjoyed this book, I felt like the author forced two books into one - the history of Crete and the modern day endurance stories. It didn’t always flow well. Still, I recommend this book to anyone into health and fitness.

BOOM! Half way done with my goal of reading 50 books in 2020. I’m stoked to have crossed the mark with such an awesome read.

Earlier this week I was on a conference call explaining a client situation to my colleague Matt. Matt unknowingly slapped me right in the face when he responded “go figure that two hotheads don’t get along.” I was one of the hotheads he was referring to.

It sucks that Matt said that. It sucks more that he’s 100% right. Actually, he was right about the W<span class=""text_exposed_show"">esley of ten years ago. 40-year-old Wesley is certainly not the extreme hothead 30-year-old Wesley was. I’ve worked hard to change. I have changed. I’m thoughtful and logical, but occasionally that hothead creeps out like it does in most humans. In fact, it did earlier that same day on a text exchange with Matt and others.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

I have a lot of weaknesses but perhaps my greatest strength is that I’m self aware. I know exactly what my weaknesses are and being the perfectionist that I am, I work very hard to be better than I was yesterday. That’s one reason I’m diving so deep into stocism. I don’t want to be known as a hothead and the only way to change decades of being known as a hothead is to not be a hothead. I also don’t want to feel anxiety, concentrate on materialism, give up when pain and suffering arrive or even fear death.

I really loved this book because it uses the lessons taught by all Stoic writers but focuses on the teachings and life of Roman Emperor and philosopher Marcus Aurelius and summarizes them into a How To book.

We learn:

How to speak wisely
How to follow your values
How to conquer desire
How to tolerate pain
How to relinquish fear
How to conquer anger
How to view death

This is one of the best books live read during my journey to 50 books in 2020. I recommend it to everyone looking to be better and to do better.

<h3>I recently finished all four adult books (he also has a children’s book) by former Navy SEAL Jocko Willink. Two of those books are co-authored by his SEAL colleague Leif Babin.  I loved all four of these. Three of them are now required reading for my company leadership team. The fourth, Discipline Equals Freedom, should be required reading for every human. I absolutely loved all four of these books.</h3>
&nbsp;
<h2><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Discipline-Equals-Freedom-Field-Manual/dp/1250156947"">Discipline Equals Freedom: Field Manual</a>, Jocko Willick</h2>
Our nation is going soft, especially during this crisis when folks seem like they cannot decide for or take care of themselves, instead relying on government to tell them what to do. Frankly, I don’t even recognize this nation anymore and that started well before this crisis. People are soft. People are sheep.

This nation was built by tough men and it will be killed by soft ones - both mentally and physically soft people. Our nation seeks comfort rather than challenge. So w<span class=""text_exposed_show"">hen the challenge arrives we fold. Very few seem to want to put in the hard work. Everyone wants the easy path.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

“People look for the shortcut. The hack.

And if you came here looking for that: you won’t find it.

The shortcut is a lie. The hack doesn’t get you there.

And if you want to take the easy road, it won’t take you to where you want to be: Stronger. Smarter. Faster. Healthier. Better. Free.

To reach goals and overcome obstacles and become the best version of you possible it will not happen by itself. It will not happen cutting corners, taking shortcuts, or looking for the easy way.

There is no easy way.

There’s only hard work, late nights, early mornings, practice, rehearsal, repetition, study, sweat, blood, toil, frustration, and discipline. Discipline.

There must be discipline.”

If you believe that as much as do, you will love this book as much as I did. Today I finished former Navy SEAL Jocko Willink’s fourth book, his second field manual. I loved this one even more than I loved the previous three. I’ve never read a book that summarizes my own mindset so succinctly.

This book doesn’t give you a life plan, although it does give you a short workout plan at the end. This book tells you how to think. It’s broken up into 58 different sections, most of them no more than two pages long. Jocko explains how to think, how to train and how to eat.

Just some examples:

How to deal with negativity.
How to deal with stress.
Why you should embrace the suck.
Why you should wake up early.
What to eat.
The importance of being able to protect yourself.
Why diversity is good.
How to view death.

Everyone should read this book today. Then they should start thinking like Jocko. Not only can this mindset save you. It can save this nation.

This is hands down the best leadership book I have ever read. If you lead any group of people, especially in business, you need to stop what you’re doing and order this book right now.

A leader should take responsibility for every failure.

A leader must explain the why and not just the what.
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

A leader must keep missions simple.

A leader must identify and mitigate risks before the mission.

A leader must lead both up and down. Lead up by giving superiors all information they need.

Leaders must build a decentralized command structure.

Leaders should not try to manage more than six people.

The lessons from former Navy SEALs Jocko Willink and Leif Babin go on and on.

I loved this book and can not recommend it enough. Go get it now.

Finding balance can oftentimes be so hard. When to push and when to relax. When to punish the children and when to let it go. When to eat the burger and when to eat the salad. Finding balance is especially hard when leading people.

How do you lead while not micromanaging?

How do you push people hard without burning them out?
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

How do you keep discipline without killing culture?

How do you plan while remaining flexible?

How do you keep focused while keeping your eye on the big picture?

For me I’ve even struggled with how much I should hang out with my team after hours.

It’s all a delicate balance or what Willink and Babin call “the dichotomy of leadership.”

As part of my journey to 50 books in 2020 I am reading all four of Willink’s adult books (and two coauthored with Babin) back to back. This is number two and like ‘Leadership Strategy and Tactics Field Guide’ I absolutely loved this book. This is a must read for any person leading a group of people.

</div>

I’ve been obsessed with special forces since my first GORUCK event a few years ago. I won’t go into all the detail of how much craziness I’ve done and how much pain I’ve put my body through at the hands of special forces operators. I’ve written about that extensively.

It’s not the physical hardships or even the weapons training that had the biggest impact on my life. From these operators I learned how I want to lead my company. Through all the pain I learned that the mental<span class=""text_exposed_show"">ity, culture and operations of special forces units translate well into business.￼ That’s exactly what Jocko Willink lays out in this book, a must read for all business leaders.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

Jocko writes “when you are a leader, there are no excuses, and there is no one else to blame. You have to make decisions. You have to build relationships. You have to communicate so that everyone can understand. You have to control your ego and your emotions. You have to be able to detach. You need to instill pride in the team. You need to train the team. You need to be balanced and tactful and aware, and you have to take ownership. The list goes on and on and makes up this incredible complex undertaking that we call leadership. And if you do all the things well – if you lead effectively - the team will be successful, and the mission will be accomplished. If you do not lead effectively, it will fail, and the team will not accomplish the mission. Leadership is all on you. But at the same time, leadership is not about you.￼”

If you lead teams of any kind, you need to read this book.

7980,"Leadership, Parenthood and Mindset","<h3>I’m on a roll finding good books to read. I really enjoyed all three of these. While they may not seem like they have a lot in common, they really do. Mattis discusses leadership and Davis writes about parenthood, both are really about Dweck’s mindset.  I recommend all three.</h3>
&nbsp;
<h2><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Call-Sign-Chaos-Learning-Lead/dp/0812996836"">Call Sign Chaos</a>, Jim Mattis &amp; Bing West</h2>
I have a lot of regrets but I try not to focus on them. Every action has led me to where I am today with my beautiful wife and three amazing boys. However, there is one regret I think about more than the others - not serving my country.

In hanging out with two of my best buds, Rick and Mark, both of whom are veterans, I realize there are very few people with whom I share the same mindset. The same goes for when I do GORUCK events with special forces operators or in this case,<span class=""text_exposed_show""> read about Former Secretary or Defense Marine General Jim Mattis. I think I would have thrived in that environment. They think how I think. I also would have rather done more this great nation. I should have put my own life on the line for these freedoms we all take for granted and which at this time are just trampled on. I guess I will settle for trying to elect good people and getting laws passed that will strengthen America.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

I loved this book mostly because I love the mindset of Mattis. Just read some of his most famous quotes:

“I come in peace. I didn’t bring artillery. But I’m pleading with you, with tears in my eyes: If you fuck with me, I’ll kill you all.”

‘Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.”

“You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil. You know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.”

And what has become a personal motto of mine:

“If you haven't read hundreds of books, you are functionally illiterate, and you will be incompetent, because your personal experiences alone aren't broad enough to sustain you.”

This book is marketed as a leadership book and there are a lot of lessons to be learned from it. However, this is much more of a history lesson on the Middle East conflicts under Presidents Bush, Obama and Trump. If you’re looking for a leadership book I recommend going with those of Jocko Willink. If you want to read about one badass American and his mindset toward life, pick this one up.

It’s a cosmic joke that Elizabeth Donehue and I had three boys. I constantly joke that I don’t know how to do manly things. I had to call Phil Bailey over to fix a doorknob. Jordan Bryngelson and Brandon Lutes came over late night to save Superman from the toilet. Jason Fry and Bradford Beavers have come over more times than I can count. Hell, my father-in-law fixed our couch just this past weekend.

I don’t hunt, although I have stabbed a few hogs with Matthew Nichols. I don<span class=""text_exposed_show"">’t fish. Beyond changing a tire or jumpstarting the battery, I cannot fix a car. I don’t do a lot of things I need to teach my boys. I guess that’s the result of my father dipping out early and me being a punk teenage kid that didn’t take advantage of the opportunity I had with my step-father.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

With so much I cannot teach my boys for now I’m focusing on what I can teach them. I can teach them love and empathy and the importance of faith. I can teach them how to defend themselves and others. I can teach them how to be healthy mentally and physically. I can teach them the importance of thinking big and pushing themselves to their limits. I can teach them how to embrace the suck and get comfortable being uncomfortable. I love when my boys see me cross a finish line.

I can also learn. I’m learning chess because Harlowe is into it. I’m seriously considering taking classes in hand to hand combat. I’m on a constant path of self improvement and I want to teach the boys everything I learn.

That’s what this book is about. The author, a former Navy SEAL, is teaching his boys all the important life lessons he learned in training and in combat. Many of them I have already mentioned above - discipline, confidence, determination, mental toughness and health. Why and how to stand up to bullies. Why and how to run away from a fight. When and how to fight. The importance of training. Putting family first.

This book teaches all the same lessons you learn from most books written by SEALs. But how Jocko Willink takes the next step and applies those lessons to leadership and business, Eric Davis applies those lessons to fatherhood.

This was a quick pager turner. I really enjoyed it and recommend to all fathers, and even mothers, of boys.

I’m weak. I can get strong.

I’m slow. I can get fast.

I’m smart. I can get smarter.
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

We aren’t a match. Marriages take work.

I’m the best and there’s no reason to practice. I can always get better.

The former of each is an example of the fixed mindset. The latter are examples of the growth mindset. You want the growth mindset.

Three years ago I had a big goal. I wanted to be an IRONMAN. Just one problem... I didn’t know how to swim. My first triathlon outing was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. It took me 21 minutes to swim 600 yards. I had to swim to the shore multiple times and walk in waist high water. I swam to a kayaker who nearly took me out of the water. My buddy Old Flame <a class=""profileLink"" title=""Dave Moore"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/dave.moore.507679?__tn__=%2CdK-R-R&amp;eid=ARASR-7Kdrmr2IF6DCrewmNCHfIbOOeO-Uio0Qixh_I3auyzZKpbPsRFsxIaoMTQQnqufYqFUyWSDMKk&amp;fref=mentions"" data-hovercard=""/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=1362204002&amp;extragetparams=%7B%22__tn__%22%3A%22%2CdK-R-R%22%2C%22eid%22%3A%22ARASR-7Kdrmr2IF6DCrewmNCHfIbOOeO-Uio0Qixh_I3auyzZKpbPsRFsxIaoMTQQnqufYqFUyWSDMKk%22%2C%22fref%22%3A%22mentions%22%7D"" data-hovercard-prefer-more-content-show=""1"">Dave Moore</a> swam by and asked “dude, are you okay?” No, Old Flame, I was not. Hearing my friends and family cheer me on had the opposite effect. They made me want to cry. I couldn’t believe people, including my children, were watching me fail so spectacularly. As I write this I cringe just thinking about it.

I didn’t stop after that day. I didn’t have a fixed mindset telling me “just stop, this isn’t for you.” I kept at it and got better and better. Now I’m an IRONMAN who has completed numerous triathlons and even swam 2.5 miles in the Charleston harbor. And I’m not finished.

I’m proud of my accomplishments but I’m not telling you this to say “hey, look how awesome I am.” I want you to see how much I absolutely sucked, got over my fear of both drowning and embarrassment, and went out and accomplished my goal. You can do that, and much more, if you develop a growth mindset in everything you do - business, fitness, marriage, parenting, friendship... everything!

I told you this before. Once someone told me on Facebook “Wesley, you think you are so much better than everyone else.” That’s only partially true. My goal isn’t to be better than you. My goal is to always be better than I was yesterday. But yes, I do believe I am better than some people because I believe people with a growth mindset are better than people with a fixed mindset. That’s because people with a growth mindset are actively trying to be better.

The parts of the book about self improvement are fantastic, but even better are the parts about parenting. Dr Dweck goes into amazing detail about how parents can help their children develop a growth mindset rather than a fixed mindset. Thus, I recommend this book to all parents.

This book is a game changer and should be read by everyone. Stop being satisfied with who you are. GROW! Never stop growing! Go reach the potential God has given you.

“It was the breaking down that built me up.”

In that one sentence Scott Jurek explains exactly why I do all the craziness that I do.

I have had the bug for some time but after reading this book I’m ready to sign up for my first real ultra marathon. I say “real ultra” because I’ve done a few ultra relays where I’m part of a team and ran over 40 miles. But in each I had breaks and I didn’t run continuously. I’m ready to jump into the real thing.
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

I’m a big fan of Scott Jurek. He’s one of the best ultra marathoners of all time, known for fueling his body on a vegan diet. His first book Eat and Run is a favorite. Jurek is also a center figure in one of my top three favorite books of all time, Born To Run.

I loved this book but I can’t say that you would love it. I loved the pain and how Jurek was able to overcome it to set a new record for running the entire Appalachian Trial. This is story of digging deep to reach that goal, something I’ve had to do on numerous occasions. It most reminded me of that painful GORUCK HTL in Normandy, but only 43 days shorter. I hate even comparing the two, but I know how it feels to have absolutely no physical or mental strength left. I know how it feels to sleep while walking and to not even know where you are. I know it and I love it. I yearn for it. I want to be completely beat down because only then can I be built back up.

If that’s you, you’ll love this book. If you’re not into endurance events, this may not be the book for you. It’s a great story full of lessons on overcoming the most difficult of circumstances to reach your monumental goals.

If you’re reading this book review you are currently online. If you haven’t already, any minute now you will be hit by some whiny comment from a soft minded person seeking offense in everything. This once mighty country that stood up to the most dangerous evils the world has ever seen, this nation that became the world’s super power through hard work and brute strength, this nation that never once cowered in the face of adversity is now on the decline because weakness has bec<span class=""text_exposed_show"">ome a celebrated virtue. Bitching instead of building, offensiveness instead of fortitude, laziness instead of resilience. They try to ruin people for every little mistake, bad joke or comments made decades ago. Everything is taken out of context and blown out of proportion. Hell, you saw what happened with me. Everything is under attack, even manliness itself.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

This book tackles the problem, explains how we got this way and what we need to do to fix it. Former Navy SEAL and now Congressman Dan Crenshaw should have titled this book “A Social Media Manual” and Facebook and Twitter should make this required reading before someone is able to active an account.

There is a lot to say about this short book. I’ll just tell you that I absolutely loved it and leave you with the ending, a code Crenshaw says we all should live by. I agree...

“I not quit in the face of danger or pain or self-doubt; I will not justify the easier path before me. I decide that all my actions, not just some, matter. Every small task is a contribution toward a higher purpose. Every day is undertaken with sense of duty to be better than I was yesterday, even in the smallest of ways. I seek out hardship. I do not run from pain but embrace it, because I derive strength from my suffering. I confront the inevitable trials of life with a smile. I plan to keep my head, to be still, when chaos overwhelms me. I will tell the story of my failures and hardships as a victor, not a victim. I will be grateful. Millions who have gone before me have suffered to much, fought over hard, and been blessed with far too little, for me to squander this life. So I wont. My purpose will be to uphold and protect the spirit of our great republic, knowing that the values we hold dear can be preserved only by a strong people. I will do my part. I will live with Fortitude.”

Now get off the internet and read this book before you get back on.

<h2><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Book-Five-Rings-Way-Warrior-ebook/dp/B07NDLBGT2/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=The+Book+of+Five+Rings&amp;qid=1590680750&amp;sr=8-1"">The Book of Five Rings</a>, Miyamoto Musashi</h2>
“Do nothing that is of no use.”

- Miyamoto Musashi

I got my first campaign job twenty-five years ago when I was just fifteen years old. While I learned some valuable lessons from mentors like Terry Sullivan, Warren Tompkins and Rod Shealy, the truth is that from them I did not learn a lot of tactics. I learned the way to look at political scenarios and other thirty thousand foot views of general direction, but all the specific tactics I learned from years of trail and error. Doing it myself. Figuring out what works and what does not work. I didn’t learn it from getting a political science degree at the University of South Carolina or through my masters studies in communications. I learned by doing.

The Book of Five Rings is generally thought of as one of the great books on martial arts and warfare strategy. Written nearly 400 years ago, Miyamoto Musashi, considered the best samurai of all time, gives us lessons still used by strategic thinkers today, much like Sun Tsu. Reading Musashi or Sun Tsu isn’t enough to become a master strategist. You must spend 95% of your time doing, but as General Jim Mattis says “if you haven't read hundreds of books, you are functionally illiterate, and you will be incompetent, because your personal experiences alone aren't broad enough to sustain you.” That’s why Musashi spent his last months alive writing The Book of Five Rings.

I loved this book for a lot of reasons, but first and foremost because throughout this short book Musashi repeatedly says that a samurai cannot learn by reading alone. Nearly every section ends with “you should investigate this thoroughly,” meaning one must research, practice and reflect every day. That’s exactly what Musashi himself did. He didn’t write this book until he was dying at sixty years old. He says he didn’t learn from instructors or fancy schools. He spent the first thirty years of his life practicing to become the best samurai ever. By focusing on just that he says “from one thing learn ten thousand things.” Oh I love that. Then he spent the next twenty years reflecting on what he learned. Finally at sixty he wrote it all down.

Just a few of my favorite quotes:

If you wish to control others you must first control yourself.

Today is victory over yourself of yesterday; tomorrow is your victory over lesser men.

There is nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to get better, stronger, richer, quicker, or smarter. Everything is within. Everything exists. Seek nothing outside of yourself.

You should not have any special fondness for a particular weapon, or anything else, for that matter. Too much is the same as not enough. Without imitating anyone else, you should have as much weaponry as suits you.

You must understand that there is more than one path to the top of the mountain.

Get beyond love and grief: exist for the good of Man.

And my favorite quote that I want to tattoo on myself:

Do nothing that is of no use.

If you pick up this book and only look at it as a martial arts book then you will wonder why I even recommended it to you. But if you pick it up and look past the martial arts and toward the larger view of strategy and even of life itself, you will most likely love this book as much as I did. This one immediately goes to my list of top ten favorites.

7987,"Hillbillies, SEALs and Stoics","<h3>Navy SEALs and stoics have been a common theme here in my book reviews and today we add a third - hillbillies. Okay, perhaps not specifically hillbillies but over the next few months I’m diving deeper into studying poverty and it’s impact on our nation for both white and black communities. As a man who grew up in poverty, this is an issue extremely important to me.

WOW! Just WOW! I feel like I just read my own biography. I don’t know how to review this book because every single chapter, every story, triggered a memory. This book hit me harder than anyth<span class=""text_exposed_show"">ing I’ve ever read. I found myself staring into nothingness in deep thought. I found myself waking up in the middle of the night unable to go back to sleep. I even found tears falling down my face twice.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

Maybe one day I’ll give this book a proper review but I fear it may require a book of my own.

You need to read this book to understand so much of our culture and to truly understand America. Take these stories out of Appalachia and put them in any poor neighborhood and the circumstances are the same. This book is a masterpiece.

Too many fall down and refuse to get back up. Too many self sabotage and instead of learning from their mistakes they get caught up in the endless cycle - screw up, apologize, promise to do better, screw up, rinse and repeat.

Too many think it’s too late. They’ve become something else and there is no going back. There isn’t even going forward. There is only going deeper. Such is the story of many addicts. You know them. I was raised by them. Perhaps you are them.

This a sto<span class=""text_exposed_show"">ry of redemption proving that addiction can be broken and that the downward spiral does not have to continue. It’s not easy. Relapse will likely happen. Struggle will definitely happen, every day. But you can do it. You can even become an American hero. Navy SEAL Adam Brown proves it.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

Adam Brown was a great kid, student and athlete. Unfortunately after high school he fell in with the wrong crowd, specifically with a garbage girlfriend. He started using drugs and eventually became an all out crackhead. He lost everything including his family, his health and nearly his life. He hit rock bottom and after trying repeatedly to break the cycle he leaned on God. Then he joined the Navy to give himself structure. He set a goal of become a Navy SEAL. He became one of the baddest sons of bitches this country has produced. He had four fingers blown off. He even lost his dominant eye. Still he trained, learned how to reshoot and proved himself enough to go back into active duty with his unit.

I wish I could tell you that this story has a happy ending, but it does not. Adam Brown was killed in Afghanistan protecting his SEAL brothers. He left behind a wife and two children.

Adam Brown is a true American hero. You need to know his story. Read this book.

“Admit not sleep into your tender eyelids till you have reckoned up each deed of the day. How have I erred, what done or left undone? So start, and so review your acts, and then. For vile deeds chide yourself, for good be glad.”

- Epictetus

How To Be A Stoic is a great introduction to Stoicism but after spending much of 2020 reading Aurelius, Seneca and Epictetus, I found this to be very repetitive. However, if you have no interest in reading those ancient texts yet still wan<span class=""text_exposed_show"">t to digest the philosophy, I very much suggest you read this book.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

I’ll give you just a few of Pigliucci’s Stoicism lessons:

1. Understand that virtue is the highest good, and everything else is indifferent.
2. Apply reason to social life.
3. Understand the dichotomy of control - what is and is not under our control. Only worry about what is within our control.

In other words, live the Serenity Prayer: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.

4. Examine your impressions and understand that most things are not inherently good or bad. It’s your impression of what is good or bad. This will help you avoid rash emotional reactions.
5. Remind yourself of the impermanence of things. We are mortal. Your spouse will die. Your kids will die. Remembering this fact will make you more enjoy every second with them.
6. Speak little and well.
7. Choose your company well.
8. Respond to insults with humor.

There are many more lessons here but I won’t list them all. That’s cheating. Go read.

If you’re looking for an introduction to Stoicism or just a quick summary instead of reading the classics, pick up this book. If you’re well studied on Stoicism already you can go ahead and skip this one.

Dave Asprey’s latest book is a lot to take in. His previous book, Game Changers, has a lot of science, but this one is all science. It’s much harder to digest and must be read slowly.

I found myself spending more time on Google reading articles then I did in the book itself. Every paragraph seemed to lead me down a rabbit hole of research.

There’s a lot in here that I’m going to experiment with. Some I’m already doing. Some, however, is still a bit extreme for me. I doubt I’<span class=""text_exposed_show"">ll be pointing lasers at my brain or microdosing nicotine anytime soon. There is, however, a lot of supplements and other weird biohacking techniques I’ll be researching soon.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

I enjoyed this book because I’m into bio hacking. I do lots of things most people don’t. I’m experimenting with smart drugs. I get IVs often. I try out lots of supplements. I do vibration, sauna, compression and cryotherapy. I try to fuel my workouts with fats rather than carbs. Most of it started with my obsession with Dave Asprey’s Bulletproof Company. I want to be faster, stronger, smarter, more mobile and able to go longer. Most of all I want to live longer. If you’re into experimenting on your own body then this book is for you. If you think that all sounds nuts, you should skip this one.

<h2><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812993543/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"">Between The World and Me</a>, Ta-Nehisi Coates</h2>
I put up this book review last week before all the protests. It didn't get much traction because it's so much easier to pay attention to some little meme than something like an actual book.

Anyway, go read this book. My review is below. That is... if you want to take the time to understand the African American community rather than just share some meme to seem woke because it's cool right now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If I hear one more middle class raised white person tell me how I should act and feel about African-Americans in an attempt to be “woke” I might scream. They don’t know. I don’t know.

I’m obviously not black. I do have white privilege. No amount of empathy will ever let me truly know what’s it like to be black. I won’t ever know what it’s like to be looked down upon because of my color.

But I do know what it’s like to be looked down upon because I was WITH black boys. I know what it’s like to be thrown on the ground by cops with a gun to my back because I was with black boys. Twice actually. I know what it’s like to be housed in the same slums, fed shit food and provided medical care by government just like those black boys. I went to the same schools where we were beat up, drugs were sold and guns were often found. We suffered from the same exact socio-economic plague. The author goes into great detail talking about these problems unique to black communities. What he doesn’t mention is that within those black communities a few white people are trickled in. I was one of those white people. As a kid I had the same fear of violence and had to live by what he calls “the law of the streets.” For me everything was the same. Everything except the color of our skin.

Growing up in the slums and Section 8 housing of North Charleston, South Carolina was rough. I lived much of the black life. But I was not black. I was one of three or four white families in our apartment complex. The author states that the fundamental difference between whites and blacks is that whites will never live in a black body thus they will never know what it’s like. He’s right in part, but I also know a bit what it’s like because I was treated the same way because I was with them. On other occasions I saw it with my own eyes. It’s real. Stop denying it.

The bigger point of this book is the author’s argument that the American Dream is really a white dream that blacks folks do not have equal access to. White America was built on the backs of enslaved African Americans. We then released the slaves and gave them nothing. They’ve been trying to play catch up ever since but they never will catch up as a community because they lack equal access to everything from education to healthcare. On top of that they are actively fought through racist acts such as profiling or police violence, as we’ve repeatedly seen, including this very week. All of that is correct.

I have one big problem with this book. The author, who himself fought the odds and succeeded, is telling black youth that they are stuck, which I believe is a recipe, if not an all out excuse, for failure. He says to “not struggle for their conversion,” meaning whites people. He writes that no matter what, the American Dream will always be for white people because success is defined by white people. A black person will only be “a successful black” and not equally successful. Frankly, he makes a damn convincing argument. He tells the story of a friend who made it out and was still gunned down by police in a traffic stop. You may tear up hearing the words of the man’s mother. It makes sense that giving in would be his answer. But what if Martin Luther King, Jr or Jackie Robinson threw up their hands and said “well it’s always going to be this way?” He believes that white supremacy will never be beat, so just give in.

I call bullshit. If that’s the case, why even write this book? Why share all the images of George Floyd? Why are people rioting right now?

We act because by acting we can change the world. The author doesn’t seem to like America very much and really, I get it from his point of view. Black men are killed and the killers walk free. But if anything this nation has proved two things - first, it’s the greatest nation on Earth and willing to put itself and it’s people on the line for doing what’s morally right. Second, it’s willing to change, even if that change is slow. In one chapter the author says that things have gotten better and then in the next he says that there’s no changing it. That just doesn’t at all make sense.

This book is beautifully written by an obviously brilliant man. While I don’t agree with his conclusion, he does a great job of summarizing what being black in America is like. It should be read by everyone so that we can have more empathy and love for our black neighbors rather than just share memes and graphics. Then we can come together and fix this nation, even if Coates doesn’t think that’s possible.

The E-Myth Revisited was a game changing book for me. Much of Push Digital’s processes and my role within the company changed after reading the book in January. I decided to dive in deeper by reading Gerber’s follow up.

I’m not going to go as far as to say I was disappointed. It’s a good book. It’s just that after the first which totally flipped my mind, this didn’t have the same impact. Occasionally there is an exception like Empire Strikes Back, but rarely is the sequel as <span class=""text_exposed_show"">good. Maybe I’m being too harsh. This is a very good and useful book.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

The first half concentrates on the entrepreneurial mindset with a deeper dive on transitioning from the manager to the leader. The second half focuses on the sales funnel and acquiring clients, people who come to repeatedly, rather than just customers. All very useful!

I definitely recommend this book to all entrepreneurs but I do give caution. Don’t go into this thinking it’s going to change your life like the first one. You don’t need your life changed. You just need to add on to what you’ve already learned.

But
I don’t have time.
No one will read them.<span class=""text_exposed_show"">
I should be concentrating on other things.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

Pressfield calls all that resistance. It can come from external pressures. Much of it comes from internal pressures. Resistance stops the creative mind from taking on these big projects or once their taken on, even tackling the day to day work.

While the book was written for creatives it’s been widely accepted by leaders within business, athletic and many other industries. What’s stopping you from starting that business, tackling that marathon or growing your family? It’s all resistance. And it can be overcome. Pressfield does a beautiful job explaining how.

This is a short book that I recommend to every single human looking to do more with their life. It could very well be life changing for you. Read this one today.

<h2><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X9MH57F/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0"">My Vanishing Country</a>, Bakari Sellers</h2>
<div>

Growing up I used to love going to see my cousin Courtney. She was just a couple years older than me and my sister. She was my favorite person in the whole world. Her brother, Chuck, was a good bit older than me so I wasn’t as close to him. He was off doing teenage things while Courtney, my sister Jennifer, and I were busy being foolish children. Their mother, my Aunt Linda, was always the rock of my father’s side of the family. I remember thinking she was rich. She wasn’t. At all. It’s just that she was the only person who had a job and a car that actually ran. She lived in a real house that didn’t have wheels. She was one of the only stable people in my life. The only one who wasn’t full of drama. She just had her shit together. Her husband, Bubba, I remember being a strange man. Mostly because he had this man cave behind the house and he never left it. I would be at their house for days and only see him when it was time for dinner. I often think of that man cave and wish I had one.

Aunt Linda, Uncle Bubba, Courtney and Chuck lived in Hampton, SC. I went there this week to see Aunt Linda. Unfortunately it was for Chuck’s funeral. I hadn’t been there for seven months. That trip was for Uncle Bubba’s funeral. Courtney died fifteen years ago, something I still think about nearly every day. That one was as tough on me as losing my parents. The other two times I was there in recent years was for the death of my grandmother, Mimi, and my father. I just saw my father’s final resting place for the first time this week. Now Mimi, Dad, Uncle Bubba, Courtney and Chuck are all lying together side by side. Everyone is vanishing.

Now it’s just my Aunt Linda. So much loss for one person to endure. And it’s that turmoil that summarizes my feelings about Hampton, Varnville, Ridgeland and the surrounding areas of rural South Carolina. These once burgeoning towns of commerce have become economic wastelands full of poverty and needing attention from those of us who forget they exist. Just so much despair. While I look at rural South Carolina with fond memories of playing with Courtney, competing in Hampton’s Watermelon Festival watermelon eating contest and all the love given to me by my Aunt Linda, I also see it the way Bakari Seller’s sees it... vanishing.

I picked up this book because <a class=""profileLink"" title=""Bakari Sellers"" href=""https://www.facebook.com/bakari.sellers.9?__tn__=%2CdK-R-R&amp;eid=ARDVwmVLGfBqjAMMkcwWk8zz9UCOzhgvXsInK7Woor44D4pSV9kB3bbZBLXLaSD6W8yGC8ztxC9v3iyQ&amp;fref=mentions"" data-hovercard=""/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=610590042&amp;extragetparams=%7B%22__tn__%22%3A%22%2CdK-R-R%22%2C%22eid%22%3A%22ARDVwmVLGfBqjAMMkcwWk8zz9UCOzhgvXsInK7Woor44D4pSV9kB3bbZBLXLaSD6W8yGC8ztxC9v3iyQ%22%2C%22fref%22%3A%22mentions%22%7D"" data-hovercard-prefer-more-content-show=""1"">Bakari Sellers</a> is my friend and I wanted to support him. I’m very fond of Bakari, more than just about any other person I’ve met in politics, because he cares so damn much. He’s a black Democrat. I’m a white Republican. We often don’t agree on the solutions but we both agree on the most fundamental problems plaguing our state. We talk about the same things. While his views are through the eyes of a black man raised in rural South Carolina, mine are through the eyes of pure white trash who grew up in a single wide trailer with holes in the floor, then Section 8 housing, spending my summers in rural South Carolina and then moved slightly up in the world when I moved to Goose Creek. While I don’t know what it’s like being a black man, I do know what it’s like being in poverty. And I know with 100% certainty that the issues Bakari describes in this book are true. If I didn’t experience them, I witnessed them with my own eyes.

This book is a memoir. It’s Bakari’s story of being raised by a civil right’s activist in rural South Carolina, not far from Hampton. He eventually became the youngest SC House representative and then he ran unsuccessfully for Lt Governor against now Governor Henry McMaster. He’s now a successful attorney, CNN analyst, husband and father.

It’s a weird coincidence that I finished this book the day I drove through Hampton to Chuck’s funeral. Every page described what I saw driving in the funeral procession. There are no jobs. The schools are falling apart. The health care systems sucks. Access to quality food sucks. The infrastructure is falling apart. The people seem forgotten, especially the black ones. But like my Aunt Linda, all that turmoil has made rural South Carolinians strong. Too strong to beg for help, but needing that help still... before they and their country truly vanishes.

PS - I don’t ask for prayers often, but if you would, please pray this week for my Aunt Linda, Chuck’s wife Sheila and his children, Chase and Malorie.

<div>

So much in our world is going wrong because supposed “leaders” have become so selfish instead of looking out for the group as a whole. Politicians care more about being elected than the true needs of their constituents. CEOs take huge bonuses while laying off staff. Television news stations are driven by profits and viewership rather than for the reason they were created.

That’s what this book is about - where leadership went wrong. Sinek’s message is that true leaders prior<span class=""text_exposed_show"">itize the needs of the group over their own. He begins by talking about the evolution of man and how the need for hierarchy and leadership is rooted in our DNA. Leadership began as a safety mechanism. Humans grouped together out of a need to protect themselves from both animals and other humans. Eventually leaders emerged whose entire job was to protect the group.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

That’s a far cry from where we are today. We’ve become comfortable. We don’t need to look out for others so that they l look for us. Thus the need for safety has taken a back seat to a desire for better, faster and more. We want everything now and we wan’t more of it - especially money. We’ve become inherently selfish creatures while dehumanizing others. So there’s no wonder that the CEO cashes out for life while firing those who can barely afford to live as is.

Sinek concludes by explaining how true leaders should act and how we can return to a day where the leader looked out for the group, citing examples like James Sinegal, the CEO of Costco, who gave raises during the economic downtown because employees needed more money, not less.

Leaders eat last because they need to ensure that everyone else in the group has been fed. I love it! This nation would be in an entirely different place if we took Sinek’s advice. This is a book that should be read by anyone who leads a group of people.

Who do you know that’s a millionaire? How about your next door neighbor who has driven the same care for 15 years? How about that guy driving the Tesla and wearing the custom suits?

According to this book answer may surprise you. The authors didn’t set out to write a how to book like most. Instead they analyzed millionaires to find common traits. Here are a few:

They are extremely frugal and live below their means.
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

They concentrate on building wealth instead of making money.

They would rather be financially independent than flashy.

They were not supported financially by their parents.

They do not financially support their adult children.

They are constantly paying attention to the market to find opportunities.

They went into the right occupation for them.

Concentrating on long term wealth instead of immediate money is something I’ve been concentrating on for the last two years. I learned that from the Rich Dad, Poor Dad books. Money is a means to an end and not the end itself. Money should not be stored away like a squirrel stores nuts. As it’s said “don’t work for money, make money work for you.”

I really enjoyed this book. Anyone looking to build financial wealth and gain true financial freedom should read this one.

There are many ancient Stoics but three stand above the rest because of their writings - Seneca, Emperor Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus. Epictetus was a slave turned teacher who didn’t actually write anything down. His words have been passed down to us by one of his students in the form of Discourses and The Enchridion, the latter being more like a Cliff’s Notes version of Stoicism.

Earlier this year I devoured Seneca and Marcus Aurelius quickly. In fact I’ve already read Medi<span class=""text_exposed_show"">tations by Aurelius twice more since. It is the one book that remains in my bag at all times. Epictetus on the other hand I took in slowly. I read a page each day for three months, meditating throughout the day on what I read.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

Like I wrote in my review of Seneca and Aurelius, it’s hard to describe a book so life changing and so full of advice that fundamentally evolves the way you think and act. So instead of trying to summarize this book, I will simply let Epictetus speak for himself and strongly urge you to read this book, along with those of Seneca and Marcus Aurelius:
Keep the prospect of death, exhale and all such a parent tragedies before you every day – especially death – and you will never have an abject thought, or desire anything of excess.

It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows.

It is not events that disturb people, it is their judgments concerning them.

There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power or our will.

Don’t hope that events will turn out the way you want, welcome events in which ever way they happen: this is the path to peace.

Freedom is the only worthy goal in life. It is won by disregarding things that lie beyond our control.

Freedom is secured not by the fulfilling of men's desires, but by the removal of desire.

If anyone tells you that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not make excuses about what is said of you but answer, ""He was ignorant of my other faults, else he would not have mentioned these alone.”

Any person capable of angering you becomes your master; he can anger you only when you permit yourself to be disturbed by him.

There is so much more in this book. I will be digesting it for years to come. You should definitely read this.

A short review this time...

So many times in life we shy away from the crucial conversations we desperately need to move forward in life, both personally and professionally. Maybe we don’t want the drama. Maybe we are just too shy. Many times we are just too scared.

These conversations don’t have to get overly emotional and you don’t need to stress about them. There are strategies to help you tackle them and move on. You learn those strategies in this book.
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

I recommend Crucial Conversations to everyone in business, so much so that it’s the next book in the Push Digital leadership book club.

Kendi</span></h2>
This was a tough one to read. Tough, because it is deep and so full of facts that it must be consumed slowly. And more so, tough, because it opens up so many wounds by making our historic atrocities so transparent and relevant to today’s circumstances.

As a history book, I loved it. Kendi is brilliant and one of the best researchers I’ve ever read. It’s like a 600 page timeline. It jumps from date to date so full of facts that at times it’s damn near impossible to keep up with Kendi. It’s a history that every American, especially those of us in the South, must know and fully understand. We cannot say “that’s in the past” as everything happening today is because of the past, thus the past is the present. That’s the majority, the first four parts of the book, and it’s wonderful.

Then comes Part 5 where Kendi turns from historian to political activist. I have many disagreements here. Kendi believes any criticism of welfare programs is racist, as if every government program isn’t full of fundamental flaws. I’ve been on welfare. I’ve seen the flaws with my own eyes. My own father told me that he doesn’t work “because government pays me to stay home with you.” He became lazy, a drug addict, a criminal and eventually he became dead because of it. My father was a white man.

I saw my neighbors, both white and black, waste their lives away sitting on their couches smoking cigarettes and never even trying to get a job. These aren’t accusations. These are experiences. My experiences. That doesn’t make me racist. It makes me aware of my surroundings.

At the same time, I saw people use welfare as a temporary safety net while getting more training or searching for a job. That’s what my mother did. That’s why I know welfare is needed.

But in Kendi’s view, any and all criticism of welfare is a campaign tactic to pit whites vs blacks to gain political support. Does that happen? Absolutely! However, Kendi never admits that these government welfare programs absolutely do have the many flaws pointed out by these politicians. And those flaws are causing minority communities A LOT of harm.

Kendi doesn’t just attack every Republican. He goes after Bill Clinton for the Crime Bill and for claiming that Black people must take some personal responsibility. The latter is quite frustrating as Kendi is fully against personal responsibility and feels that any mention of such is racist. Even Bill Cosby (before his downfall) and Barack Obama is called racist for promoting hard work, personal responsibility and good parenting. He argues that it just produces more racism. I don’t get it and Kendi poorly supports his argument.

My biggest issue is that while he brings to light so many atrocities, Kendi becomes lost in accusations of subtle racism such as the movies Avatar and Rocky. Somehow, Rocky is all about the white man beating down a black man, but Kendi never mentions that it’s the black man who won at the end of the first movie. If the movie is about a white man beating down a black man, and that’s one big ass IF, the result is that no matter how hard the white man works, he still won’t keep the black man down. Seems to me that’s anti-racist.

I do agree with Kendi’s view on the War on Drugs. We now have states profiting from marijuana sales while too many, especially black men, spend years behind bars while prisons become overcrowded for the same reason. Additionally there’s is just no explaining away the differences between crack and cocaine sentencing. It’s racist.

Kendi does not give a solution to the problem. He believes the key is to put more anti-racists in power. If President Obama isn’t included in that list then I don’t know who is.

Despite his stretching and my political disagreements based on personal experiences, I found this book to be both enlightening and needed in today’s world. Kendi is a brilliant historian. We must fully understand the past to understand today’s obvious racial disparities. This book should be read by all.

I look forward to starting Kendi’s second book “How To Be An Anti-Racist” next week.

<h2><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Way-Love-Meditations-Anthony-Classics/dp/038524939X""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Way to Love: The Last Meditations of Anthony de Mello</span></a></h2>
WOW! My goal 50 books in 2020 is DONE!

What a wonderful book to hold as I cross that finish line.

So much of what we call happiness is thrust upon us from external forces. We are told that riches, fame and approval will make us happy. Most of the time they leave us empty, especially when compared to the internal feelings we acquire from our soul. These are the positive emotions we get when we see a sunset, read a great book, play with our kids or cross a finish line. These a<span class=""text_exposed_show"">re the things we truly love. It’s the difference between being empty and being nourished.</span>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">

Anthony De Mello was a Jesuit priest who wrote down these 32 meditations just before dying. In these short meditations he teaches us how to seek true love rather than the emptiness the world tells us we should pursue, that which our cultural programming tries to define, but which is actually undefinable. We either have it or we don’t.

De Mello challenges us to open our eyes and to see more clearly that our ill conceived attachments are not making us happy and we must shed them if we are to truly love. Those attachments stop us from loving other things and love excludes nothing. It’s like loving drums so much that when you hear a symphony you only hear the drums, which stops you from hearing the beautiful music of the entire work.

Obviously this passage hit me square in the jaw:

”You were bent on winning an election and in the din of battle it was impossible to hear the songs of birds: Your ambition drowned out every other sound. You were faced with the possibility of a serious illness or the loss of a loved one and you found it impossible to concentrate on anything.”

This is a small book. In fact it’s so small that I have the pocket version. You can read it in one day. I opted to read it over a month so that I could meditate on each, well, meditation. That seems to be what De Mello had in mind. This is another life changing book that must be read by everyone.

And with that I complete my journey of reading 50 books in 2020. I would have never imagined knocking it out in half the time. My journey is far from over. The point was not to cross a finish line and to yell “look at me!” The whole point was to create a new habit. While I will not slow down the reading, the number of books I consume will slow down. I’m about to dive into some thick biographies. So, let’s see how far I can go in 2020.

</div>
<div dir=""auto"">
<div class=""o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">Somehow I forgot to write a book review for #51 so here it is a bit late.</div>
</div>
<div class=""o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">We all have shit of which we need to let go. As I sit here today I’m obsessing over a US Senate candidate who won his primary last night. If you go to his website today you’ll see our work. We were his digital team and we were absolutely crushing it. Then we got canned when the candidate hired a new consultant who recently purchased himself a shiny little digital agency. We did everything right. Our work was solid. We worked around the clock. Hell, we got fired the day after working through a holiday weekend. It didn’t matter. That’s business. And politics. Still it burns.</div>
</div>
<div class=""o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">But what can I do about it? I cannot reverse time. I cannot fix the nature of business or politics. I can sit here stewing. I can get anxious and angry. I can waste my energy and as Carlson writes “completely lose touch with the magic and beauty of life.”</div>
</div>
<div class=""o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">Or I can get over it, learn and adapt. In the end, this isn’t a big deal. I have plenty more clients and our team is absolutely crushing everything it touches this year. We are about to have the best year in our ten year history. That’s what I should be focused on. In fact, that IS what I am focused on starting right now. Carlson asks “will this matter a year from now?” The answer is absolutely not. So why the hell should I even care? I don’t.</div>
</div>
<div class=""o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">This is a great book to get your mind right, especially during this insane year of anxiety. It’s broken down into 100 short chapters, typically about two pages, that is easily digestible. I decided to read two chapters per day so that I can meditate on them, much like a devotional. Just some of my favorite lessons:</div>
</div>
<div class=""o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">Make peace with imperfection.</div>
<div dir=""auto"">Be aware of the snowball effect of your thinking.</div>
<div dir=""auto"">Create ‘Patience Practice Periods.’</div>
<div dir=""auto"">Allow yourself to be bored.</div>
<div dir=""auto"">Imagine yourself at your own funeral.</div>
<div dir=""auto"">Repeat to yourself, “life isn’t an emergency.”</div>
<div dir=""auto"">Set aside quiet time, every day.</div>
<div dir=""auto"">Become a better listener.</div>
<div dir=""auto"">Choose your battles wisely.</div>
<div dir=""auto"">Breathe before you speak.</div>
<div dir=""auto"">Just for fun, agree with criticism directed toward you.</div>
<div dir=""auto"">Think of what you have rather than what you want.</div>
<div dir=""auto"">The next time you find yourself in an argument, rather than defend your position, see if you can see the other point of view first.</div>
</div>
<div class=""o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">And my favorite - Ask yourself if this will matter a year from now?</div>
</div>
<div class=""o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">Carlson wrote a short book that can change many lives. I recommend this one to everyone, especially those feeling down during the 2020 shitstorm.</div>

<div dir=""auto"">I choose not to be part of the Washington, DC bullshit. I choose to raise my family in America’s best city. I choose to remain independently owned.</div>

<div dir=""auto"">My company has stood strong for ten years and we are poised to expand even more in the coming years. It’s been tough, mostly because I haven’t followed the path of my competitors. I’ve had to play a different game all together. I’ve had to go the other way.</div>
</div>
<div class=""o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">You’ve probably seen this movie. It’s one of my favorites and I think about it every single day. I’m constantly asking myself - how I can play the game completely different than my competitors? How can I recruit clients and staff differently, or in the case of this story, how can a team recruit players differently? Once that stable of clients, or players, is complete, how do we do the work differently?</div>
</div>
<div class=""o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">In so many ways Push Digital is the Oakland A’s of political, advocacy and reputation agencies. We aren’t part of the cool kids club in DC. We don’t have all the money of big financial backers. We have to be scrappy. That forces us to be more creative, more strategic and in most ways, more stable as a company. We haven’t had the big boom and busts we see with our competitors. We’ve slowly grown as a solid agency that has stood the test of time.</div>
</div>
<div class=""o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">This book is about baseball, but more so, it’s the story of a business that was forced to go the other way. They played by a completely different set of rules and through a lot of experimentation they found a formula for success, one that has been replicated by nearly every other baseball team.</div>
</div>
<div class=""o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">I love this book even more than I love the movie. The added detail is exactly what I needed to hear right now. If you’re the David facing a Goliath, this book is for you. It’s for the underdogs willing to play a different game and willing to go the other way.</div>

<div class=""kvgmc6g5 cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">This one will be a short book review. I’m traveling with the family and it’s damn near impossible to write with my three little monkeys jumping all over everything.</div>
</div>
<div class=""o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">Anytime a self-made man who has built $17 Billion in personal wealth gives advice, we should listen. Presidents Bush, Obama and Trump have called on him for financial, strategic and political advice. That alone is enough for me to pick up his book.</div>
</div>
<div class=""o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">Stephen Schwarzman is one of the most influential men in the world that you’ve probably never heard of. Schwarzman founded investment firm, The Blackstone Group, with just $400,000 in seed funding. The company went public in 2007 with a $ Billion IPO. Today Blackstone manages about $550 Billion in assets.</div>
</div>
<div class=""o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">This book is memoir also full of great advice. Honestly, a lot of the advice is high level. This guy is a straight up baller. I wouldn’t say his advice is necessarily for small business folks. Maybe even not for medium sized business folks. Those who run large businesses should definitely read this book. Or, perhaps anyone just looking for some motivation. Schwarzman was a nobody who became one of the richest men in the world who is sought after for advice from the most powerful men on the planet. I sure wouldn’t mind being like him.</div>

8081,"PUSHING SC SENATOR CHIP CAMPSEN’S CAMPAIGN","South Carolina State Senator Chip Campsen is one of my all time <strong>favorite</strong> clients. I adore him and his wife, Lalla Lee, for many reasons. Elizabeth and I have always looked up to them as a model for our own marriage and family. Their <strong>values, intelligence</strong> and <strong>commitment</strong> to our local community are traits for which I strive daily. When Chip asked me to help with his re-election campaign I jumped at the opportunity.

Fun story… my first official date with Elizabeth is tied to the Campsens. In 2004, I ran a primary campaign against Chip. I asked Elizabeth to join me for our election night “victory party.” I embarrassingly got my butt kicked in front of my hot date. So I did what one should do after such a defeat. I drove over to the Campsen victory party, hot date in tow, to congratulate our opponents on their win. The Campsens graciously accepted me at their event and asked me to join their runoff campaign against the incumbent State Senator. I joined the team the next day, we won and my political career received a <strong>powerful</strong> jumpstart.

Sixteen years later I now have the opportunity to show the voters of South Carolina’s lowcountry how Chip Campsen has become one of, if not <em>THE</em>, <strong>most effective legislators</strong> at the South Carolina Statehouse.

Recently we launched a new TV ad and a series of digital ads in the district.

14395,"The 90 Books I Read In 2020","The more I learn, the more I realize that I know nothing. I’m ignorant. Thus began my journey to read fifty books in 2020.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I learned much, both in terms of knowledge and about myself, and I have much to write. I hope to do so soon. As for now I will simply leave you with the list of ninety books I finished. Yes, ninety! One of the few benefits of COVID was less travel, giving me more time at home and in the office, and allowing me to surpass my goal by a complete forty books, something I never thought possible.</span>

I hope you find something useful here:

15600,"Personal Life Changing Books","I’ve been messaged a ton this week asking which are my favorite books I read in 2020. That’s such a hard question to answer so I’m going to break this down into three categories:
<ol>
 	<li>Personal life changing books</li>
 	<li>Business essentials</li>
 	<li>Most enjoyed books</li>
</ol>
Let’s start with personal life changing books. These are the books that have changed my mentality, soul and daily habits. I strongly recommend each of these.

15615,"Business Essentials Books","I knocked out a lot of books on business leadership, management and finances in 2020. Here are those I would categorize as business essentials. If you are an entrepreneur, executive, manager or in any kind of leadership role, you would be making a mistake not to consume this material.

I hope these help you as much as they’ve helped me. Wishing you many Positive Vibes!

18602,"Crisis Is Coming","It’s not a matter of IF, but WHEN crisis will come. The question is - will you be ready for the fight?

Starting today you’re going to see a big change in my online presence. Over the past year, I have narrowed the scope of what I want to focus on, what I want to study, what I want to be the best in the world at and what I want to help others with.

When you look at my life—my upbringing, my love of endurance events, what I help politicians and corporations do—it all seems to fit perfectly into one box: helping people through crisis situations. Helping them endure something really hard and coming out the other end with their reputation intact.

I’ve used tried and tested strategies and tactics with political candidates, groups and corporations for over twenty years. And coming off of 2020 and the chaos of early 2021, I’ve witnessed that most people don’t know how to deal with the world crises we find ourselves in.

So for the duration of 2021, all my content, even my book reviews, will be analyzed through the lens of crisis. It’s all about trouble. What can politicians, groups, corporations and even individuals do to make it through a real fight? I will share why I think crisis can be a good catalyst and why each organization and person needs crisis—needs trouble—in their lives.

This all starts today. I hope you can use what I’ve learned along the way to guide you in your life this year.",,2021-01-20,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/crisis-is-coming/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/210120_Wesley-Donehue-_Crisis-Is-Coming_964X482.png,crisis-is-coming-feature-image,,,crisis-is-coming-feature-image,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/210120_Wesley-Donehue-_Crisis-Is-Coming_964X482.png,,Blog,,publish,6,lianasarapas,liana@pushdigital.com,Liana,Sarapas,crisis-is-coming,,,0,0,0,open,open,2021-01-20
18605,"Slow. It. Down.","“When you slow the process down, you also calm it down.”

* Chris Voss, Never Split The Difference

In his bestselling book on negotiation, hostage negotiator Chris Voss writes that one of the first rules of dealing with a crisis situation is to slow it down. In his example, two bank robbers have taken hostages while the FBI is speeding through the process quickly to fix the situation, mostly because the press is watching. But in speeding through the process the FBI hasn’t thoroughly analyzed all aspects of the situation. After slowing down the process, Voss learns that one of the robbers didn’t want to be there. In fact, he had no idea they were robbing a bank and taking hostages. He thought the job was to rob an ATM. By slowing down the process and seeing all angles of the situation, Voss and his colleagues were able to talk one robber into coming out which led the lead robber to also come out. Speeding through the process could have resulted in many people losing their lives.

Crisis is uncomfortable and we often want to fix it immediately. Sometimes a crisis must, in fact, be remedied quickly. However, I’ve found that most of the time slowing it down is the key to finding the best solution. It gives you the ability to calmly think through all aspects of the crisis. So, take a deep breath before you move. Look at the whole board. See the move you may not have first seen in the midst of chaos.

“Never Split The Difference” has many more tips and tricks to dealing with crisis and negotiation. It’s not just for business. Even marriage and parenting is often a negotiation. I definitely recommend this book.

18616,"Build Your Tribe","In Sebastian Junger’s “Tribe,” we are told stories of miners trapped underground, the English during the World War II Nazi occupation and American troops as they served abroad—and then as they returned home. In each case, the lesson is that tribes of people come together during crises to overcome difficult or seemingly impossible scenarios. Junger believes that a tribe is the community in which you live and share resources with. It is a group of people that you would risk your life to defend.

He cites fascinating studies during WWII where the people residing in locations bombed the most, such as London and Dresden, saw the highest morale as well as the most industrial productivity. Other areas of the UK or Germany that were not in the direct bombing zones saw lower morale and productivity. They did not experience the same urgent need to pull together to survive. He writes:

“Intrigued by the fact that in both England and Germany, civilian resilience have risen in response to the air raids, Charles Fritz (the study author) went on to complete a more general study of how communities respond to calamity. After the war he turned his attention to natural disasters in the United States and formulated a broad theory about social resilience. He was unable to find a single instance where communities that have been hit by catastrophic events laps in to sustain a panic, much less anything approaching anarchy. If anything, he found that social bonds were reinforced during disasters, and that people are overwhelmingly devoted their energies toward the good of the community rather than just themselves.”

Here, we see an example that I tell all clients, both political and corporate. Only hire people you can trust to stand beside you during war. Only hire people you want in your bunker. While you may not live together, you do share resources. It won’t be your life, but your organization’s life is likely to be on the line. Can you trust that your people will come together such as those studied by Charles Fritz? You have to. Because at some point, the bombs will come. The only way to survive them is to build a tribe of those you can trust absolutely. Surround yourself with an inner circle that will come together to fight the enemy during a crisis.

This book was required reading in the GORUCK Tribe program - https://www.goruck.com/pages/tribe. I’m glad I was made to pick this one up because I will now be recommending it to all my clients.

18620,"What Kind of Hustler Are You?","There are two types of hustlers. Those running toward something and those running away from something. Im the latter. Like Alexander Hamilton, I will never be satisfied. It’s not because I’m greedy and want riches. It’s because people like me always think the other shoe is going to drop. We are always waiting for someone to take everything away, to go back to where we came from. We are always waiting for the crisis to hit. Thus we are always preparing. The hustle is preparation.

This week I made three big announcements - a new company, a new office building and two new rental properties. This isn’t me bragging. This is me trying to teach you what I’m learning. I’ve spent the last three years taking every free second to learn. I read. I watch endless YouTube videos. I’m desperately trying to improve my financial education.

Here’s what I learned - something you’ve already heard for years - the key to preparing for a financial crisis is diversification. For me that’s businesses, stocks, real estate and now I’m even dabbling in crypto. I don’t buy expensive things. No toys. No boats or fancy cars. Many of my staff drive nicer cars. My assistant’s assistant has my same car but ten years newer. I dump my money into investments for diversification so that when the crisis hits, I’ll be prepared.

As I said earlier this week - learn and move.

Learn - read and watch - improve your financial education.

Move - diversify - find new pipelines of income.

I recommend three books:

18626,"Trust, the Internet & the Way Forward","Over the past year, we began to see the true power the internet can have in confronting our existing power structure–and perpetuating conspiracy theories and organizing fringe groups. You no longer need to have deep pockets, a structured organization, or a seat at the table to have a voice.

Last year, people organized online and took to the streets to protest the killing of Black people. Last month, people organized online to storm the U.S. Capitol. And, last week, people organized online to stick it to Wall Street.

The internet has upended culture, politics—and now—the financial market.

It’s a matter of trust. People don’t trust government, law enforcement, politicians, financial institutions or companies anymore.

I worked for SeaWorld and those people did not know what hit them. They didn’t understand how a documentary could go viral, leading to the creation of millions of negative memes, turning the company into one of the most hated in America. They didn’t take the threat seriously, going an entire year without even addressing Blackfish. It wasn’t until we stepped in and advised them on how to re-establish their reputation and rebuild trust with their consumers that they were able to start moving past the negative press stemming from that single documentary.

The internet isn’t going anywhere, and an individual with a keyboard is just going to get more powerful.

18629,"What I Learned About Crisis During GORUCK Normandy HTL","Who would you cuddle with?

Seriously, if you just got your ass kicked for 38 hours and you seriously thought you were on the verge of hypothermia, who would do you trust enough to snuggle up close to?

This is Hotspot, Mark Baker. We’ve been to Hell and back together. A few times. We were in the middle of the GORUCK Normandy HTL (a 40+ hour ass kicking at the hands of special forces operators). We were about 30 hours in when two “teammates” started fighting. Cadre Dan just looked at us and said “you guys are going to pay for that.” We did too. It wasn’t some kind of short beat down to make us cry. It was long and drawn out over hours and hours.

In pitch black we rucked for the entire night through the fields of Normandy. The same ones you see on Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan. Hours upon hours carrying our rucks, sandbags and anything else Cadre Dan could find. It was one of those times when the body suffered tremendous pain but it was our minds that suffered the most. One step after another. Total boredom. Only the thoughts of how bad our blisters and sand rashes between our legs hurt kept our minds occupied. But every single step Hotspot was there beside me.

Eventually the sun came up and we ended on Omaha Beach. Here we enacted the D-Day landings by forming in the shape of Higgins boats and storming the beach. Low crawls, bear crawls, back in the water, storm the beach, low crawls, bear crawls, back in the water. Over and over and over.

It was the coldest water I had ever been in. But it was okay because the crawls warmed us up. And then the worst part of the entire event happens. Story time!

Yes, story time was the worst part. Sitting on our asses and doing nothing was the worst part. You see, Cadre Dan put us back in the water and then took us out to tell us the story or the Normandy invasion. He didn’t give us the crawls to warm up our bodies. He just sat us on the beach in 35 degree temperature with the wind howling. It was genuinely one of the worst hours of my life.

Hotspot was just as cold. We didn’t say a word. We just put our arms around each other and shared our body warmth. It was all we could do to make it through phase 2 and onto the final phase of the event. 38 people started. 16 of us finished. I would not have been one of those 16 had I not had Hotspot beside me... right beside me.

So you may not cuddle with your teammates or clients, but in the middle of a crisis you better have people that close to you that you can absolutely count on. Repeatedly I’ve seen clients get in trouble and instead of bonding together like me and Hotspot, they fought like those two idiots who got us Cadre Dan’s wrath. They go into personal survival mode and start blaming each other. Every single time the crisis gets worse and sometimes it burns down the whole organization.

Only hire people you can trust to be right beside you in the cold and darkness. Only work with clients you trust. That’s why one of our company values is “we only work with clients who love and respect us.” You never know when the hard times will come, but make no mistake about it, they will come.

18635,"Prepare the Body and the Mind","A book review of <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Own-Day-Your-Life-Optimized/dp/0062684078"">Own The Day</a> by Aubrey Marcus

I am no doomsday prepper. I don’t have an underground bunker in my backyard... yet. But I would be lying if I said that 2020 did not put some new fear in my mind and that I did not act on that fear.

A global pandemic hit us hard (in case you haven’t heard). Suddenly we saw grocery store shelves empty—canned goods, water and toilet paper were gone. Riots broke out in downtowns across America. Here in Charleston, our beloved King Street was nearly destroyed. I spent hours one Sunday boarding up stores in downtown Summerville. I was verbally accosted at a political rally and I truly thought it was going to become violent. I saw things I thought would not and could not happen in America. So I acted.

I started adding more strength training to my daily routine so that I can get both faster and stronger.

I started taking Krav Maga classes to learn hand-to-hand combat.

I stocked up on ammunition and got back to the range every other week.

I recommitted to daily meditation and next week I even start a transcendental meditation course.

I read 90 books in 2020.

And much more.

Since I’ve led you down this path, let me state clearly that Aubrey Marcus did not write a crisis preparation book. He wrote an amazing book to help you live a more fulfilled life. I’ve read countless self improvement books and I believe Marcus does a really nice job of summarizing many of them in one place. He has such a great outlook on life, and here, he explains how to improve both your body and your mind in order to live each day to the fullest.

With that said, I know that the best way to make it through a crisis is to have your mind and body already in tip top shape. In business and politics, you have to be able to think clearly. That’s the very foundation of crisis communication. If caught in a riot, you have to be able to think and respond quickly. This book can help you get there.

I especially love the sections on the importance of getting comfortable with the uncomfortable. It’s something that prepares both our minds and bodies at the same time. It’s why I’ve recommitted to something I absolutely hate—the Wim Hoff Method and daily cold showers.

Marcus writes, “Most of us have shied away from the accrue stress of difficult conditions. We chose cozy over cold, automatic over intentional. And with nothing to harden us, we get soft.”

He continues, “Think about it. Our cars have climate control. We have jackets and scarfs and fans and air conditioning. We can spend the whole day in our offices, lunch delivered, without ever going out in the blistering Texas heat or the biting Chicago wind. If we are lucky our homes have heated floors so that when we get up in the night our little feetsies. Our entire culture is built on the pursuit of the comfortable and the elimination of the difficult.”

He’s right. We are building a culture of soft humans and soft humans rarely make it through crisis easily. We need to harden ourselves in preparation for what is definitely coming, either in our professional or personal lives.

There are many of these type books out there but I found this one to be one of the best. I definitely recommend.

I finally picked it up and was not let down. This is a must read.

The book begins with the dawn of man and works its way through the cognitive, agricultural, scientific and industrial revolutions until it reaches today. Chapters focus on religion, capitalism and globalization until it reaches a conclusion about man’s constant search for happiness and eventual immortality. The author argues that those searches will lead to the end of man with a transcendence past our biological limitations. He’s probably right.

Science fiction will become reality.

I loved this book and recommend to anyone who desires to understand how we got here and where we are going.

18751,"Is Speaking Out Worth The Trouble?","Gina Carano, Justin Timberlake, Bruce Springsteen, RFK Jr, and Morgan Wallen are all under fire from cancel culture this week. Some rightfully so, others not so much.

The one most intriguing to me is the ongoing saga of Gina Carano. Partly because I’m a huge Star Wars fan (as I write this I just got back to the hotel from Galaxy’s Edge with two new lightsabers), but mostly because this was coming for months and Carano didn’t seem to care.

Hers is a story of the ongoing bias against conservatives in Hollywood. People, including celebrities, are encouraged to speak out for causes they believe in. We are told that change never occurs when we stay silent. Carano believes it. She refused to stop talking despite daily threats, petitions and boycotts. Disney warned her. She didn’t listen. She spoke out.

The real question -- is speaking out worth it anymore when you have so much to lose? Carano wasn’t handed success. She worked her butt off for it grinding in the gym and literally fighting her way to the top of MMA. She became a star on one of television’s top show and in a franchise that would give her eternal fame. She was slated for her own show in the Star Wars universe.

You would think she would be celebrated for breaking stereotypes of what female actresses should look and act like. Instead she’s being cancelled. Even the Cara Dune action figure has been cancelled by Hasbro, so it would seem s we’ve now transcended the screen and have begun cancelling the characters themselves.

I’m not defending her content. Some I wholeheartedly agreed with. Some I agreed with but thought was presented a bit too edgy. Some I disagreed with. But if those same ratios were applied to a liberal actor or actress, would they be cancelled? Just look through Twitter for the obvious answer. They would have been hailed as heroes, as liberals now have a monopoly on what is right and what is wrong. That’s not a partisan view. That’s a fact being repeatedly proven with the rare exception of someone like RFK Jr who could not possibly survive during the COVID pandemic.

Knowing that fact, what’s the point? Is it really worth losing everything you’ve fought for your entire life to prove a few points on social media that will be forgotten in a week? At this point, do you even know what Carano said to be cancelled? Did those points change anyone’s mind on anything?

She didn’t do anything special to be remembered. She was just one of billions of voices lost in a world of online clutter. She just ran her mouth like everyone else in this hyper partisan world.

If you have something to lose, there will always be someone with nothing to lose trying to take it from you. There are times when speaking out truly matters.

18760,"THE GREENVILLE NEWS: “SC SMALL BUSINESSES NEED A LOUDER VOICE”","<em>The following guest column appeared in the Sunday print issue of The Greenville News on February 21, 2021.</em>

As a political consultant, I’ve written the line, ‘Small business is the backbone of our economy’ for countless organizations, candidates and officeholders.

What could be seen as a meaningless cliché by some is absolutely true.

As proof, prior to the pandemic, the U.S. Small Business Administration estimated that there were more than 431,000 small firms in South Carolina in early 2020, representing more than 99% of all businesses. At that time, more than 40% of our state’s workforce was employed by small businesses.

However, COVID-19 has been disastrous for small businesses, many of which were devastated in the early days of the pandemic. A study published by the National Academy of Sciences reported that 43% of small firms closed at least temporarily by late April 2020. A survey conducted by CBIZ last fall found that 37% of businesses with 20-49 employees noted a significant or severe impact on finances due to COVID-19.

A year into the pandemic, the fear hasn’t gone away, even with vaccines being distributed. According to the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index for January 2021, small business owners are increasingly worried. Owners who expect better business conditions over the next six months declined seven points to a net negative 23%, the lowest level since November 2013.

But during this time when so many small businesses need someone — anyone — to stand up for them, too many of the individuals and organizations like those I have worked for over the years have been silent.

One CEO, at least, has put his money where his mouth is. Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, has now helped raise more than $33 million from more than 200,000 contributors for countless small businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Portnoy began his mission to save these mom-and-pop shops, bars, and restaurants after the government made it clear it had no plans to step up.

This is the kind of initiative we need to see right here in South Carolina. While I applaud the great work the Barstool Fund has been able to do on behalf of small businesses, it is still disheartening to see these business owners forced to turn to such drastic measures as submitting long-shot proposals to a private entrepreneur for support, rather than being able to rely on the groups that should have had their backs.

Where have our state and local business groups been? Where are our political leaders? While the large economic engines of our state surely needed support during this time, why has supporting big business been the sole focus of many of our public officials and commerce groups?

Don’t get me wrong. We must support the Boeings, Michelins and Volvos of South Carolina. But why are we ignoring small business while watching too many of them shut their doors for good?

As an entrepreneur myself, I innately understand the stress and uncertainty that my fellow business owners are experiencing. Many of us have felt abandoned by the organizations that should have been looking out for us. Local small businesses need a louder voice in these organizations and at the South Carolina State House. We need to work together to make sure small businesses are as much a priority as large corporations when it comes to decision making.

In addition to lobbying for more financial aid and fewer regulations, I also urge all business owners to connect with their neighbors and fellow entrepreneurs. We need to work together to develop solutions for the common challenges we are all struggling to address. We need to start standing up for ourselves and raising our voices.

As small business owners and community leaders, we must continue to ask ourselves, what can we do today to make sure we’re all better off tomorrow instead of relying on business organizations that obviously don’t care about us? By banding together, I know we can ensure small businesses thrive and prosper across our state for decades to come.

18766,"Invent And Wander Book Review","<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Invent-Wander-Collected-Writings-Introduction/dp/B08LDT7YFT/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=invent+and+wander&amp;qid=1639065865&amp;s=audible&amp;sr=1-1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Invent and Wander by Jeff Bezos</a>

I’m really torn on this one. You’ll find some real gems in “Invent &amp; Wander” that every entrepreneur should read. However, I found the book to be incredibly repetitive which was frankly annoying. It’s already pretty short at just 275 pages but I feel it could have been half that.

The repetitiveness is most likely just a result of the format of the book. It encompasses all of Jeff Bezos’ shareholder letters between 1997 and 2019 and concludes with a number of speeches that he has given over the years. The book doesn’t mean to be repetitive—it’s just that Bezos repeats himself throughout these letters and speeches.

Most interesting is how we can see both Bezos and the company evolve over those years through the shareholder letters. The letters are full of lessons that every business owner should know. I was especially interested in how Bezos experiments, isn’t scared to fail, and through those experiments, he finds absolutely game changing products and services, such as Amazon Prime.

Just look at the last year and how Amazon Prime has helped save a lot of people in this country. I don’t mean that lightly and I don’t think I’m over exaggerating. Through Amazon, we no longer even need to go to the store. In the beginning of the pandemic, we were able to completely shelter in place with Amazon boxes showing up at the doorstep every day. Here, Bezos explains how his company was able to make it through a crisis while helping the country in the process.

For an entrepreneur, the most valuable lessons come in a small five page chapter titled “Thinking Three Years Out.” Here, Bezos lays out his day in which he tries to make just three big decisions every day. Those three big decisions don’t impact today, this quarter or even this year. They are decisions for three years out.

I most enjoyed Bezos’ thoughts on space near the very end of the book. They are so completely different than the views of Elon Musk, and in his words, you can even find a few subtle jabs at Musk. These two differing views and the competition between these two men may literally save the human race one day.

Look, I loved this book. I really did. I was just sick of hearing some of the same stories over and over again by the end. We get it, Jeff. Your mom got pregnant in high school and the principal tried to kick her out. Telling the story once is enough. But honestly, if the receptiveness gets us these valuable lessons, I’ll take it. I recommend this book to all entrepreneurs.

Yes, the Emily Post Institute published a book about weed.

I’m not going to post on social media whether or not I smoke pot. What I’ll say is that I’ve been around pot my entire life. It’s always been prevalent. But never before has it been as prevalent as it today. It seems to be everywhere all the time as it becomes socially acceptable and legal in more states.

Because you’re going to run into pot sometime soon and it will most likely be legalized in some form or fashion in your area within the next few years, like anything, it’s important to understand the social etiquette.

This book was gifted to me by my lovely wife because I’m very passionate about medical marijuana (and she’s very passionate about etiquette). I saw the benefits pot had for my mother’s debilitating back disease with no side effects. Unfortunately she was then prescribed opioids by her doctor which were much easier to get. She eventually became addicted. Then she overdosed and died. Had she continued treating herself with marijuana I believe she would still be alive today.

I will continue to be a loud advocate for medical marijuana. It’s going to be legal in every state at some point. This book will help you be prepared when that happens.

If there is one book you should read to change your life it’s this one. We don’t reach big goals overnight or through one big action. We reach them through incremental daily actions. This book teaches you how.

For all my glaring faults I do have one strength - I’m productive. I typically meet my goals. People are always asking me how. I find the answer quite simple although I understand it is really very difficult. For years I have followed the 1% rule. I do a few things every single day in an attempt to get 1% better. Like stocks, those actions compound. One mile becomes a 5k. A 5k becomes a half marathon. A half marathon becomes a marathon. How do you think I learned how to swim as a 35 year old adult?

This book puts into writing many of the tactics I use daily while also teaching me a few new ones. If you’re looking at changing some part of your life, start with Atomic Habits. Go get it right now.

Hey there. I have no time to write today because I’m bouncing around the country meeting with clients. I’ll make this one quick. This one was required reading for the monthly challenge in the GORUCK Tribe program. I really enjoyed it.

Sparks is a former Recon Marine and Air Force Pararescueman. He writes about the philosophical underpinnings of overcoming obstacles and extreme crisis situations. It’s all about preparing your mind and body for the toughest of situations... something you know I’m quite obsessed with.

If you enjoy war stories you’ll love this one.

18797,"The Most Reluctant Convert Book Review","There’s a big man in the sky who takes you to his happy home when you die. All your family and friends are there too. But you’re only invited if you’re good here on Earth. Honestly, it sounds illogical and like a bunch of hogwash made up by people to keep us from fearing death and to keep us from killing each other. Worst of all we are supposed to accept the story through faith, whatever that is, with no proof at all.

Yes, I’m a doubter. It’s just who I am. I question everything. I want proof behind the argument.

Enter CS Lewis, my favorite author. He is able to present arguments for Christianity based on logic rather than emotion. He helps to erase my doubt while solidly putting me back in the corner of Christianity. He was so good at this because he was himself an atheist at one point.

This isn’t the normal CS Lewis biography. The author comes at Lewis’ life through the lens of transition. How exactly did an atheist become the world’s most famous Christian apologist? Here we find the answers.

I enjoyed this short book a lot. It was what I was looking for during one of my doubting times when I typically pick up Mere Christianity. I definitely recommend it to those looking for something beyond the “just have faith” argument.

PS - doubting is okay. Doubters must reaffirm their beliefs more often and through more research. Doubt prevents us from becoming mentally lazy Christians.

Ehh... I don’t know. Maybe I was just expecting something different from the sequel to Yuval Noah Harari’s hit Sapiens.

Sapiens is a well researched and thoughtful explanation of humanity’s past. Homo Deus is supposed to be the author’s theories on humanity’s future. I was expecting many thoughts on AI, space travel and maybe even the future of globalization. Instead we are mainly presented a treatise on atheism.

Yuval Noah Harari does thoroughly discuss the concept of algorithms and how much of our lives will be dictated by them, perhaps to the point where we will be completely replaced by technology. I wish the book focused on that. Instead he focuses on philosophy and religion, how we are turning from theism to humanism. Really in many ways he believes that humanity has already abandoned theism and we are mostly an atheist planet. I just don’t get it. Statistics plainly show otherwise.

I’m torn on this review. Maybe it’s a really good book. I think you’ll love it if you’re an atheist. It’s just not what I thought it was going to be or what I was looking for. I would skip this one.

Let’s talk about tripping mushrooms.

Let me start by stating clearly that I have never done hard drugs. I was surrounded by cocaine, crack and meth for much of my younger life. I’ve never touched them. I’ve never tripped on mushrooms or LSD. I feel like I have to say that for my political and corporate clients before giving this review.

Now that’s out of the way I will say that I have a fascination with psychedelics, although I’ve never used them nor is this post meant to endorse or encourage the use of them. More specifically, I have a fascination with spirituality and other planes of consciousness and existence. I do not find it a coincidence that those who have had psychedelic experiences describe aspects similar to those taught by nearly every major religion. I also wonder if God put certain vegetation and fungi on this planet so that we can have deeper experiences and connections to Him.

Even more so I wonder if, mushrooms specifically, can be used to improve mental health as stated by numerous doctors and researchers. We focus a lot on physical health through natural supplementation. Should we do the same for mental and emotional health? Should we be activating different parts of our brains and jumpstarting neurogenesis and neuroplasticity with natural plants? Why don’t we use every part of our brain and why does psilocybin even naturally exist?

I do not know the answered but here’s what I do believe. There is more to this existence than what we can experience with our senses. There are other spiritual planes of existence. There are ways in which we can tap into those other planes without dying. If you’re a Christian you cannot read the Bible without acknowledging this. Maybe psychedelics are the answer. Maybe not. I just don’t think the questions should be culturally “wrong.”

I won’t be taking psychedelics anytime soon but I also won’t be leaving these questions alone. I’ll continue reading books and watching YouTube videos and maybe when I do not have small children, I’m retired and I can “risk it” I’ll experiment with mushrooms and perhaps ayahuasca (LSD is a no go for me). It will be a good while before that happens.

I really enjoyed this book. If you have similar questions you should read it. It not, skip it.

Side note: if you are a huge Star Trek fan you should consider picking up this book. The entire premise of Star Trek: Discovery is based on mushrooms and the mycelial network. Even a main character, Paul

Staments, is named after the world’s most famous researcher of mushrooms. He’s discussed thoroughly in this book. Star Trek: Discovery is the reason I went down this rabbit hole.

Statistically it is nearly impossible that we are the only intelligent species in existence. Scientists approximate there are at least 60 billion Earth-like habitable planets. It is the height of hubris to believe we are alone.

Avi Loeb dives deep into the studies and research of extraterrestrial life with his belief that Oumuamua, the first object of interstellar origin observed by humans, was built by intelligent beings. By the way, a new study released just this week argues otherwise, stating it is a piece that broke off a Pluto-like interstellar planet.

I mostly enjoyed this book. I enjoyed the thought behind the existence of extraterrestrial life and the reasoning of why Oumuamua was built by an alien species. However, Loeb gets lost in his own biography which at times does little to add to the book’s thesis.

I definitely recommend this book to nerds interested in the study of alien life. If you’re not, and I do not understand why you would not be, you can skip this one.

I finished this one up with just a few hours to spare for my monthly GORUCK Tribe Challenge.

You’ve seen the movie. You know the rules.

The movie pretty much follows the same path as the book with just a few notable differences, especially the ending which was changed, I’m guessing, to be more Hollywood.

Perhaps the book is about capitalism vs anarchy. Probably because I was reading it in the lens of GORUCK, this time I focused more on enduring misery alone vs overcoming misery with a group of like minded crazies. After all, that’s what a GORUCK event is. While I have been shot at in a GORUCK event (we accidentally crossed over onto private land and a redneck lunatic lady decided to scare us off with her shotgun) I’ve never beat the shit out of my buddies or blown shit up. Unfortunately.

If you loved the movie you’ll love the book even more. I recommend

Make money. Lose money.

Recruit staff. Lose staff.

Take over the world. Go on life support.

Lots and lots of alcohol.

Up then down then up then down.

This isn’t a space story. It’s a startup story. It’s one all too familiar to any entrepreneur. The difference here is a lot more money, a tropical island, lots of explosions and the goal to save mankind.

I absolutely loved this book.

Has there ever been a bigger douche biscuit in business?

It’s not because he grew a huge business and then drove it into the ground. That’s been done plenty of times before. It’s because he really wasn’t trying to grow an actual business at all. He was building a cult. All of which was built on this idea of “we.” Then he screwed the “we” left his team broke and broken and then escaped with a golden parachute worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Never before has a man needed his ass physically whipped more than Adam Neumann. Okay, probably not “never before” but this guy definitely needs his ego put in check.

This messianic wannabe is a con artists completely full of shit and his antics make for an absolutely wild and fascinating story.

I recommend.

This book has some strong concepts that everyone needs to know, namely that our societal, economic and government structures were established by the elite to keep the elite the elite. Specifically the monetary and education systems are meant to keep the rich rich and the poor poor.

The problem is that this book is so repetitive that it cannot be enjoyed. He could have boiled it down to ten pages and gotten his entire point across, but then he couldn’t have made money on a book. He just regurgitates the lessons and stories from his classic “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” while focusing repeatedly on this article by Stephen Brill - https://time.com/.../baby-boomer-generation-america.../...

So read Rich Dad, Poor Dad. It’s a game changer. Then read the Brill article. Then absolutely skip this book.

Thanks for the cover pic, Robert. I agree. A big thumbs down.

I’m going to keep this one short because the author, Cyrus Krohn, has agreed to be a guest on our new podcast, Under Fire, where we will talk about the daily crises happening because of social media.

I’ve know Cyrus for many years and I think he’s brilliant. He was actually ahead of me in adopting digital in politics which is saying something because I consider myself one of the first to jump on this train. While I’ve kept up over Facebook with what Cyrus has been up to, I didn’t realize until the epilogue of this book that he’s been doing a lot of work in other nations, especially Malaysia.

This book was really weird for me because I found myself both loving it and hating it at the same exact time.

I loved this book because Cyrus rightly lays out the role social media and digital as a whole has played in the political fracturing of America. I hated it because in doing so Cyrus makes me feel like complete shit as there is little doubt that I have played a part, maybe a large part, in creating the problem.

Cyrus goes into detail explaining where this is all heading if we don’t shift course, the way we got here and a few solutions on how we can fix what we’ve broken.

I look forward to discussing some of the solutions because, while I don’t complete disagree with them, I do have some hesitations. For starters I’m always weary of anything that starts with or includes more government regulation. Frankly, when it comes to government regulation of the Internet, I see it as a bunch of yahoos making rules about things they don’t completely or even partially understand. I’m not sure big government can solve a problem after seeing what happened when liberally controlled social media companies tried to solve the problem. I’m just more skeptical than Cyrus seems to be.

There’s also the issue of data. I think advertising sucks because we are bombarded all day every day with shit marketing we don’t need or want to see. Data makes advertising better because we are pushed ideas, news and products we are interested in. I would much rather see news about space exploration or products that build my fitness rather than ads about pickup trucks or cleaning products. The problem with this slippery slope is that we create echo chambers affirming our beliefs and even making us hate the other side rather than seeing content the broadens our minds. Frankly, I do not know how to find the balance. I really want to dive into this with Cyrus. As I write this post I think the podcast is going to have to be a two or three parter.

This nation is headed down a dark path and Cyrus explains why. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves America.

Here’s another one - a short review for a short book. This is a really great leadership book that I couldn’t put down. It’s all about asking questions, the right questions, instead of always talking. I recommend for all business leaders and sales folks.

18911,"Tragic Sense of Life Book Review","Descartes said “I think therefore I am.” Unamuno could be summarized with “I feel therefore I am,” although he didn’t say exactly that. I picked up this book because it was featured heavily in the first season of Star Trek: Picard. SPOILER ALERT. Don’t read further if you haven’t but want to watch it.

Data, an android who spent his life trying to become human, dies in the final episode. He didn’t have to die. He decided to die because humans die. Only then could he become human.

That’s the entire essence of this book. The tragic part of life is that we spend our entire lives fearing and working toward having no end. It’s those emotions about death that ultimately make us human.

I really enjoyed this book. If you’re entire philosophy, or Star Trek, read it.

Not only is the book really good, but the method itself has a ton of benefits for all individuals and especially athletes.

The message Seneca delivers here is both astounding and simple - Live right now. Carpe Diem. “The greatest waste of life lies in postponement,” he writes.

“You must not think a man has lived long because he has white hair and wrinkles: he has not lived long, just existed long.” Waking up, working, stressing, drinking, lusting. That’s not living. We waste so much life. Despite the title of this essay, Seneca says that life is long. We have time to do big things. We just don’t.

“When life is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death’s final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it… Life is long if you know how to use it.”

“Nobody works out the value of time: men use it lavishly as if it cost nothing… We have to be more careful in preserving what will cease at an unknown point.”

Read this short book.

18957,"UNDER FIRE ANALYSIS: DR. FAUCI","Dr Anthony Fauci has become the Republican boogeyman. It was predictable. In fact, I predicted it nearly one year ago when I said that he needed to take a step back from the spotlight. He was not the right man to be at the center of the nation’s public relations. Here’s why.

Dr Fauci is an immunologist. He’s a scientist. And here’s the thing about science—it changes. In fact, the whole purpose of science is to change science. It’s about discovery. What’s true today may not be true tomorrow due to research and breakthroughs. That’s the very foundation of science. It’s why his position on masks changed repeatedly over the past year. But in politics we call that lying and flip flopping.

In his recently released emails, Dr Fauci says that he feels uncomfortable in the limelight. That just doesn’t make any sense to me. Maybe he didn’t force himself to be the center of attention in the beginning of this crisis but he has certainly kept himself there at his own choosing. He throws out first pitches at baseball games. He does interview after interview after interview. He said he loved being played by Brad Pitt on SNL. And now we see that he’s writing a book to benefit financially off of this whole global crisis.

Fauci is a scientist. He isn’t a public policy expert. He isn’t a lawmaker. He isn’t a public relations spokesman. But he’s acted like all the above and now wonders why he’s the target of so much political heat. The short answer is it’s because he overstepped his position for personal gain and put himself in the line of fire.

I’m not here to argue the merits of the political attacks or the facts in his emails. They speak for themselves. And, I even won’t yell “I told you so.” I’m here to say that he deserves to be under fire. He’s a public relations disaster and he should have stuck to being a scientist behind the scenes.

18959,"WHO’S UNDER FIRE TODAY? CNN.","I didn’t think I would ever see a moment on TV more cringy than the Scott’s Tots episode of The Office. I was wrong as CNN one-upped Michael Scott yesterday when Jeffrey Toobin was welcomed back as the network’s top legal analyst in an interview with Alisyn Camerota. There’s nothing I can say to explain the cringiness of this interview so you’re just going to have to watch it yourself <a href=""https://youtu.be/8noCAW7z5Bk"">here</a>.

Did you feel completely weird like you wanted to stop the video but just couldn’t? Yeah, me too.

Why? Just why? Who is the PR genius who thought this was a good idea? Whoever it was they should be fired, but if a guy can jack off on camera in front of female co-workers and keep his job then no one at CNN should ever be fired for anything.

Before I move on to the PR side of this, let’s get one thing straight. Toobin wasn’t just jacking off in front of co-workers. He was jacking off to one of his co-workers. He thought his camera was off. I don’t see any other explanation. Yet, despite the absolute absurdity of the situation, CNN decided to keep Toobin.

That’s the first mistake. Had I been giving CNN advice, I would have told them exactly that. There’s no way of keep Toobin. Period.

But let’s say that CNN demanded it. My first advice would have been to wait longer. It had to be a minimum of one year. Next, release a short written statement. “Jeffrey Toobin is being accepted back to CNN on a trial basis after he’s provided proof of one year of mental counseling.” That’s it. Nothing else. Move on.

The interview was the worst thing CNN could have done. They put Camerota in a horrible position, made Toobin look like an even bigger jackass and gave content to fuel a viral moment that reminded everyone of what Toobin did after almost everyone, including me, completely forgot about the situation.

You see, these network types are just like DC politico types and the types at big marketing agencies in NY and LA. They live in their own bubbles and believe everyone knows and experiences what they do. They have absolutely no idea what’s going on in middle America. They don’t understand normal consumers—or voters. So in their eyes, of course everyone knows who Jeffrey Toobin is, when in fact not a damn person before yesterday could have told you who Jeffrey Toobin is.

This entire thing was one huge PR disaster.

I’m about six book reviews behind. I better get caught up...

Troops in Afghanistan ran into a big problem. They couldn’t obtain intelligence from half the population they encountered because Afghan women are forbidden from speaking to men who are not their husband. Speaking of forbidden, at this time US women were forbidden from combat arms professions in the military.

The obvious solution was to put women on the front lines for the first time beside special forces operators, so a special unit was formed. This book is all about the real life stories of the women who joined the CST (culture support team) program, from their training to their deployment. It focuses on Lt. Ashley White Stumpf, the first of these women killed in combat.

This book was awesome. I had never heard of the CST program and I’m sure most of you also have not. I’m very happy this book was mandatory for the GORUCK Tribe program. Definitely pick it up.

This one maybe shouldn’t be counted as a book but Amazon says it is and who am I to argue with the great Bezos? It’s basically a long pamphlet, or what I call a toilet read. You can knock it out in an hour. And you should. It’s just a straight up tell it how it is kick to the nuts to let you know that you’re probably not hustling as hard as you could.

There are so many self help books out and really I’m quite done with them. This is different because it’s short enough with no bullshit filler to be consumed quickly when you need a jolt of motivation.

I picked this one up at the suggestion of a social media influencer, which I rarely do. I’m glad I did. I’ll read this a few times a year when I’m feeling bla.

What the hell have we become?

Read this book to learn about when men were men. Then pick up your cell phone, open TikTok and watch grown ass men dancing around like 13 year old girls.

I first watched the HBO miniseries when preparing for the GORUCK Normandy HTL when I had my ass kicked for 50 hours on Utah and Omaha beaches and in the towns in which the paratroopers of the 101st, including Easy Company, landed. I had not read the book until now when it was required in the GORUCK Tribe program. In reading the book I rewatched the miniseries as the episodes corresponded with the book chapters. I could not believe how well the miniseries creators translated the book with damn near exact precision.

It’s hard for me to explain how much I loved this book. While I first took in this story through the lens of history, this time I took it in through the lens of current culture. I compared the strength of America to this weak and pitiful bullshit we’ve become, where masculinity is toxic, it’s okay to burn down a business and dancing on a burning American flag is cool to stream online.

Let’s just pray that we don’t face evil trying to take over the world anytime soon, because I’m not so sure there are a lot of men like those of Easy Company left, and those who do exist are being told they shouldn’t.

“How long are you going to wait before you demand the best for yourself?” ⁃ Epictetus

For me the answer was “way too long.” And in many ways I’m still waiting. Every day I find myself wanting to engage in a social media argument. Today’s culture tell us to “speak your truth.” But why? How many times have you been convinced by a social media debate? How many times have you been like “yeah, he’s right, I’m changing my mind?”

No one’s mind is changed on Facebook or Twitter. We come to these platforms so that our opinions are reinforced. We want that hit of dopamine that comes from all the likes, shares and “yeah you’re rights.”

Ask yourself - what do I have to gain from getting in a social media argument?

Then ask yourself - what do I have to lose?

Let’s talk about me, my favorite subject, for a minute. I’ve never gained one dollar from a social media fight. On the flip side I was named Worst Person In The World by Keith Olbermann on MSNBC. I’ve made national news multiple times. I almost lost my brewery investment.

For what? To prove my point? To put someone in their place? To prove I’m intellectually superior?

It’s ego. Plain and simple. Pure stupidity.

I’ve gained nothing, embarrassed myself and my team, had people harass my family, lost clients and cost myself a minimum of one million dollars. I almost lost more than that.

I write this today because I woke up to a comment on my last post and I wanted to argue. Then I realized that I have absolutely nothing to gain and my limited mental energy is better spent elsewhere.

So ask yourself something today - is this comment worth it? Then ask ask yourself what Epictetus asks - how long am I going to wait before I demand the best of myself?",,2021-07-30,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/is-the-social-media-fight-worth-it/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210803_Wesley-Donehue_Book-Review-Social-Media_01.png|https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Is-The-Social-Media-Fight-Worth-It-scaled.jpeg,"210803_Wesley Donehue_Book Review Social Media_01|Is-The-Social-Media-Fight-Worth-It?",|,|,|,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210803_Wesley-Donehue_Book-Review-Social-Media_01.png,,Blog,,publish,6,lianasarapas,liana@pushdigital.com,Liana,Sarapas,is-the-social-media-fight-worth-it,,,0,0,0,open,open,2021-08-04

I’m so sick and tired of people telling me to slow down.

Family. Friends. Doctors.

To hell with that bullshit. I’ll slow down when I’m dead.

Mom was dead by 48.

Dad was dead by 52.

If I average them out I’ll be dead in 9 years.

I have money to make and finish lines to cross.

I have companies to build and teammates to support.

Most importantly I have a future to secure for my family. These three little guys will have the opportunities I didn’t have. These three little guys will see the world. These little guys will see that anything and everything is possible. I won’t be teaching my boys by words alone. I will be teaching them through action. Through example!

I’m not slowing down. I’m speeding up.

I won’t get stuck in the systems made by the elite to control us all like sheep. I see their traps. They won’t get me. They won’t get my boys either.

Find something that motivates you and helps you avoid the traps they’re laying. For me it’s the fact that I could be dead in just nine years. What about you?

I said I was done with self help books from online gurus but I broke my rule because I really do like Ed Mylett. I love his videos, podcast and Instagram posts so I decided to order the book he’s always pushing. I shouldn’t have. Despite being nothing more than a glorified pamphlet and only taking two hours to read, it was a total waste of time. There is nothing new in the book that hasn’t been covered by every other self help guru.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s all valuable information if you haven’t read other books that are exactly like it. The only difference here is that Mylett cuts through the bullshit and gets straight to the point with his lessons.

Crush it, 10x it or Max it. It’s all the same shit.
Wake up earlier
Work harder than everyone else
Find a purpose
Live your purpose
Meditate
Hydrate
Exercise
Live happily ever after

It’s all great information but trust me, there’s a hell of a lot more to it. More money, more problems. More staff, more problems. More competitors, more problems. Hustle isn’t everything. Because frankly, no one outworks me, but many people are richer.

I’ve also been reading some books about crypto, starting with this one about Coinbase, the most popular app to buy and store cryptocurrency. It’s a fast read and it boils it all down to its most simple explanation with fun stories to keep you interested. It’s not a technical book. It’s a good book for beginners with basic questions.

19074,"Snow Crash Book Review","<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Snow-Crash-Neal-Stephenson-audiobook/dp/B00005NZJA/ref=sr_1_1?crid=19UKXTD15PNDI&amp;keywords=snow+crash+neal+stephenson&amp;qid=1639063278&amp;s=audible&amp;sprefix=snow+crash+Neil+st%2Caudible%2C183&amp;sr=1-1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Snow Crash by Neil Stephenson </a>

You’ve heard of cryptocurrency. You may have heard of NFTs. They are all the rage right now because folks think they are a new form of asset class for investment. Others think they are a new form of digital currency. Real nerds know they are a lot more and it’s all way deeper than some get rich quick investment. They are the first signs of a new Internet, referred to as Web3.

Imagine if you could go back to the early days of the Internet. That’s where we are today. The Internet you know now will be irrelevant. A new distributed Internet will emerge based on blockchain technology and away from the big server farms of Google and Amazon. This new Internet will allow you to take your digital assets with you and into a new virtual world that you create. Think about Fortnite, but for every part of your life, and way more encompassing. Have you seen Ready Player One? It’s basically the Oasis. Today it’s called the metaverse, a name taken directly from this science fiction book - Snow Crash by Neil Stephenson.

Jeff Bezos once said “the dreamers come first. It’s always the science-fiction guys: They think of everything first, and then the builders come along and they make it happen. But it takes time.” That’s exactly right. Stephenson dreamed of the metaverse in 1992. Nearly thirty years later we see the first signs of it’s creation. It may take a couple more decades to be fully here but it will eventually be here.

Stephenson places us a few years in the future after a complete global economic collapse. Many people are living virtual lives in the metaverse when a computer virus appears that can fry the brains of computer hackers while turning normal people into religious cultists. Our main protagonists are trying to save the real world and the metaverse by figuring out where the virus comes from and how to destroy it.

Snow Crash is science fiction with a ton of religious dogma weaved within it’s action. I loved it. If you’re a nerd you’ll love it too.

19078,"Bitcoin Billionaire Book Review","Ben Mezrich wrote the definitive account of Facebook’s founding with Accidental Billionaires, which was the basis of Aaron Sorkin’s The Social Network. I’m sure you’ve seen the movie. Mark Zuckerberg totally screws over the Winklevoss twins. With “I’m 6’5, 220 and there’s two of me,” “the Winklevii” definitely come across as the losers of the story.

With Bitcoin Billionaires Mezrich tells the second chapter of the Winklevoss story as early investors in Bitcoin, founders of a crypto exchange company and perhaps the most well known team in crypto circles. The side characters in this story are also totally fascinating.

This is not a technical book. It is, however, a real pager turner. I loved it. The story is great. It can give you an introduction to crypto and the story of its earliest adopters. Even if you aren’t interested in crypto it’s a fascinating story of anyone interested in entrepreneurship or investing.

I’m about eight book reviews behind. I will try to knock them out over the next week to give you some recommendations.

Did you love The Martian by Andy Weir? If so, stop what you’re doing right now and purchase Project Hail Mary. Wier’s latest book is amazing. I couldn’t put it down and I wanted it to never conclude.

Humanity is going to end. An algae has attacked the sun and is consuming it’s energy. An ice age will hit Earth but not before the cold kills most crops, pushes all of humanity into starvation and before any of that can happen, the total collapse of society. A team has been sent to another system where a sun not being destroyed by the algae has been found. They must discover what’s unique about that sun to save ours, our planet and every living being.

Go get this book immediately if you love science fiction. I LOVED this one so much.

19092,"A New Phase","Today begins a new phase in my journey.

I have spent the last three days with a mastermind group in Ohio. As I leave this morning I’m more motivated than I’ve ever been.

I’ve always considered myself to be a hard worker and a hustler. I haven’t met a lot of men who outwork me. But the guys in this group are operating at a level that I didn’t know existed.

What’s even more mind blowing is that some of them aren’t even working that hard. They’re just working smart, much smarter than I am. They aren’t wasting their time on bullshit like political maneuvering and social media antics. They’re goal oriented, focused, determined and printing cash like it’s nothing. Their entire world view is different.

I encourage you all to seek out new relationships with people who will blow your mind. Find people operating at a higher level. Find people who will teach and encourage you. If you want to be a killer you have to surround yourself with killers.

My life is about to change and the Donehue family is going to the next level. It’s like that.

19095,"Stop Regretting","This is the biggest single change I’m making in my life - I’m going to stop regretting.

No, I’m not going to just stop thinking about things I should have or have not done.

I’m going to make sure on the front end that there is nothing to regret.

I’m going to stop hesitating. I’m going to stop stopping. I’m going to never let fear get in my way again.

I’m sitting here this morning looking at another bounce in the crypto markets. I knew last month that I should have dumped more money in. I don’t just think, I know with 100% certainty that crypto is the future. Still, I let naysayers and fear hold me back. Now I’m sitting here drinking my coffee, watching CNBC and thinking of nothing but regret. That won’t happen again.

Five years ago I told Phil, my main man at Push, that we should start a new division of the company. For some reason I told myself it wasn’t the right time although I knew it was. We had a lot of other things moving and I didn’t want to spend the $100k to get it started. Now I look back at how that industry has grown and realize I left at least $5 Million on the table just because I was scared to spend $100k.

I have a superpower. I can spot trends before they happen. I see what’s coming down the road. It’s why I saw the emergence of digital in campaigns and marketing and jumped on it early, while making no money for a few years, while all the TV guys called it a fad.

I also have a kryptonite. It’s fear. And the fear only grows larger as the family and the company has grown. There’s so much more to lose. I certainly can’t risk my family’s future.

But I know that risk is part of the game. Those who succeed are those who punch fear in the face. Those who move. Those who never regret.

So I’m done regretting. It’s time to make some moves. Let’s roll.

Wishing you so many Positive Vibes today!

W.

19098,"Giving Up Isn't The Answer","<div class=""kvgmc6g5 cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">
<div dir=""auto"">This morning we hit the road for my first triathlon since December. This one is a short Olympic distance race at Lake Logan, about 30 minutes outside of Asheville, North Carolina. Swim - 1500 meters Bike - 24 miles Run - 10k</div>
<div dir=""auto""></div>
<div dir=""auto"">I’m super excited to be racing with my friends Jenn, Alex, Chris and Jaime. But I’m even more excited to have my family there. Nothing gets me more excited than seeing my wife and three boys on the side of the road. I’m so eager to show my boys that anything is possible when they create a plan and do the work.</div>
<div dir=""auto""></div>
<div dir=""auto"">Triathlon has been a real struggle for me. Those of you following my journey over the last few years understand why. I didn’t know how to swim beyond not dying. I hadn’t been on a bike in twenty years and never on a fast road bike. I wanted to learn a new skill and I wanted the boys to see me struggle.</div>
<div dir=""auto""></div>
<div dir=""auto"">And recently, struggle I have. I tore a quad and haven’t been able to run for a month. Last week I slipped a disk in my back. For the last two days my whoop scores have been abysmal and my body definitely feels as if it’s fighting something off.</div>
<div dir=""auto""></div>
<div dir=""auto"">Still I go. Not because I even feel like racing. I go to show my boys that giving up isn’t the answer. I especially want to show Harlowe, who like his mother, is a perfectionist. He gets so mad at himself when he messes up during cello practice. He wants to quit because he can’t do it the way he wants to do it. I have to remind him of my first triathlon when I was the last out of the water. I swam to the shore and walked part of the pond. My buddy Dave swam by me and asked if he needed to grab a lifeguard. Yeah, it was that bad. It may have been the most publicly embarrassing moment of my life. But I kept going and I finished. Then with the help of Endurance Farm I built a swim plan and over the last three years I have progressed to being able to finish a 2.5 mile swim.</div>
<div dir=""auto""></div>
<div dir=""auto"">Look, I still suck. I mean I really really suck. I finish though. And my boys see me cross that finish line and they see me wear that medal for the rest of the day.</div>
</div>
<div class=""o9v6fnle cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x c1et5uql ii04i59q"">

<div dir=""auto"">These boys are going to learn that sucking is okay, but finishing is mandatory.</div>

19101,"Until The Next Adventure","Race report.

I was really worried going into this race. I trained hard over the summer and up until a month ago I thought I was in the best shape of my life. Then all hell broke loose. I injured my quad and then slipped a disc in my back. Over the past four days I’ve been pretty sick. I woke up race day feeling like crap.

Knowing I wouldn’t PR this race I went in with three goals:
<ol>
 	<li>Finish. Given my injuries this was the first race I was actually worried about DNFing.</li>
 	<li>Seek revenge on Lake Logan. I did a half Ironman distance triathlon in this lake three years ago and it was by far my worst swim ever.</li>
 	<li>Beat the crew I came with. Look, I hate to sound like a jerk but I’m competitive. It’s a good thing. Training partners make each other better by pushing each other.</li>
</ol>
Pre race: I just put in the EarPods and zoned out trying to not think about how cold the water would be.

Swim: I was in the water for 42 mins. I’m so bad. The water wasn’t as cold as I remembered. While I was slow, mentally I was in a great place. Breathing was also spot on. The back became an issue when I popped up to site. I swam half the race in a lot of discomfort. About 200 meters from the end we swam up a river which was about 10 degrees colder. It must have been the cold because when I exited the water onto the dock, both legs completely cramped and I hit the dock hard where I had to lay for a few seconds. They eased up and I sprinted to transition.

T1: I had trouble getting my wetsuit off but besides that I stormed out. I don’t believe in sitting in transition. Recover on the bike.

Bike: My best ride ever. I’m shocked. The climbs were brutal and I about pooped my pants on some of the declines. I came out of the water so far behind my crew and knew that I had to close the gap on the bike. I just put my head down and did the work in hopes that I wouldn’t crush my injured quad too hard before the run, where I excel.

T2: In and out faster than a man’s first time with a woman.

Run: It’s on. I nailed a 6:30 for my first mile. I saw Jaime and then immediately saw Jenn. I was stoked. Then I saw Chris. I had caught them all. Just one problem. The girls went in the water four mins after me so even though I passed them they were still four mins ahead of me. My quad and my back were on fire. I was in a good bit of pain but couldn’t let up. I had to gain four mins on the girls. I came to the turnaround point and saw one of the girls again way sooner than I thought. She was crushing her run. Shit!! So I just did what had to be done and worked through the pain.

Finish: I saw all the kids and choked up as soon as I saw Harlowe. Yeah, I’m a crier during races. The kids all ran to the finish with me.

2:56:46. It wasn’t a great performance but I met all my goals. I ended up beating my crew by just 90 seconds.

Summary: I have a lot of work to do in the water. I need to rest my body and fix these injuries before going too hard into my full Ironman training for the Cozumel race Nov 21. Two weeks from now I pace my mentor, Terry, as he crushes the Leadville 100 in Colorado. Luckily I only have to run 35 miles.

“We’re done with the mission. Octonauts at ease, until the next adventure.”

19104,"You're On Your Own","Masks work. Masks don’t work. Certain masks work. Masks work if you wear two of them.

Vaccinate or mask up. Vaccinate and mask up.

Vaccines work. Vaccines don’t work. Vaccines work but you need a booster.

You don’t need a vaccine if you have natural immunity. Natural immunity isn’t enough.

I could go on and on.

Trust doctors. Even if different doctors say different things.

Trust science. Even though the science keeps changing.

The only fact at this point is that facts change and we don’t know who to trust. That leaves only one person you can trust - yourself.

You hear people, including me, say “don’t be a sheep.” I’m not trying to insult anyone. I’m using the word sheep to simply and pointedly describe specific people - those who just do what they’re told without thinking for themselves. They simply follow.

For most Americans, being a sheep is just fine. If you just follow the herd you will typically end up okay. You won’t crush life, but you’ll survive.

The problem is that right now you don’t have the luxury of simply following the herd. The herd is scattered because there is no specific shepherd. The herd has no clear direction and there is a good chance the herd walks right off a cliff.

This leaves you no choice but to start thinking for yourself and taking clear action to protect your family. At some point you have to wake up and realize that no one is going to protect you. Not the federal government or state government or some medical entity. You’re on your own. You have to do it all yourself.

You also have to realize that others need to do what’s best for themselves. Get out of their business. It’s not your business why they mask up or get vaccinated, and visa versa. Their medical decision is NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS!

No one knows anything about this virus or what is going to happen. That’s obvious and if don’t see it then you have your head buried in the sand. It’s not going away anytime soon. There is no “new normal” because normal means consistency.

So you don’t have a choice. You have to start thinking for yourself. You have to start doing what’s best for your family. You have to realize that things aren’t going back to the way they used to be.

You’re on your own. Stop waiting for someone to give you permission to live. Stop accepting government telling you how to live. Stop being a sheep.

19107,"COVID 19 Vaccine: Medical Issue or Public Relations Issue?","The vaccination issue is not a medical issue at all. It’s a public relations issue. It is, quite simply, an issue of trust.

As much as Democrats are trying to blame Republicans, the distrust in government actually goes both ways.

Prior to the election Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Andrew Cuomo all stated that they would be hesitant to take any vaccine “rushed” by the Trump administration, the same vaccines being pushed today. It was these leading Democrats who first threw a shadow of distrust on the process. Governor Cuomo went so far as to urge New York residents not to take the vaccine at all. Now Cuomo is urging businesses to move toward “vaccine only admission” while wondering why there is so much vaccine hesitation.

All the while African Americans, the base of the Democratic Party, remains more than 50% unvaccinated across the nation. Some claim the stat is a result of access, while others put the blame solely on issues of trust. James Hildeth, a member of Biden’s Covid-19 task force, told Politico “we still have some places where the past history of bias, discrimination and hate has just caused such an ingrained mistrust of political and social structures that it’s hard to break through that.”

Turning to Republicans, it’s pretty obvious that a party already ideologically opposed to government action, would naturally be hesitant to anything government is pushing. Add on that it’s currently being pushed by a liberal administration, it’s easy to forget that the push was started at “warp speed” by none other than President Donald Trump. Given the popularity of President Trump we see just how much Republicans distrust government institutions and the politicians, of both parties, pushing, well pretty much anything.

Now turn to the pharmaceutical companies where my personal mistrust lies. 841,000 Americans have died from a drug overdose since 1999. 70% of those, or roughly 588,000, have died of an opioid overdose. One of them was my mother who overdosed on fentanyl. Despite this nightmare, the companies that produced these drugs, pushed them on victims and lied to the world, their leaders remain unscathed, out of prison, and still in power. This is the same industry and some of the same companies creating vaccinations and telling us they are safe. Put yourself in my shoes or anyone who lost a relative to an opioid overdose. Is it really so hard to understand why we would distrust these companies?

Now turn it around. Put yourself in the shoes of an older American, someone with an underlying health condition or someone who lost a relative to Covid-19. It is really so hard to understand why they would push vaccinations?

I write to point out that we have a much bigger problem than the current vaccination fight. Americans no longer trust America. We don’t trust our institutions. We don’t trust our leaders. We don’t trust each other.

I don’t know how to fix the trust issue but here are a few places to start:
<ol>
 	<li>Politicians should stop being lying dirtbags and think about something other than destroying the other party. Realize that you can’t have it one way when you’re trying to win an election and another way once you win. Your words have repercussions.</li>
 	<li>Criminally punish killers, like the leaders who pushed opioids on America.</li>
 	<li>Have empathy for one another. Put yourself in your neighbor’s shoes for a few minutes.</li>
 	<li>Lastly, think on the primary lesson given to us by Jesus Christ and love your neighbor as yourself.</li>
</ol>
I pray that Americans will one day trust America again. If not, we are already on the path to our great nation’s destruction. It won’t come at the hands of an enemy. The hands of destruction will be our own.",,2021-08-07,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/covid-19-vaccine-medical-issue-or-public-relations-issue/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210811_Wes_Blog-Cover_Relations-Issue.png,"210811_Wes_Blog Cover_Relations Issue",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/210811_Wes_Blog-Cover_Relations-Issue.png,,Blog,,publish,6,lianasarapas,liana@pushdigital.com,Liana,Sarapas,covid-19-vaccine-medical-issue-or-public-relations-issue,,,0,0,0,open,open,2021-08-12
19109,"Producing Healthy Americans Starts With Our Children","I’m a sickly person.

Friends will tell you that I’m always sick. If it’s cold season I’m getting it bad. If it’s flu season I’m going down hard.

The truth is that I have a weak immune system and I know exactly why. I can live an extraordinary healthy life, and I try to, but I don’t think I’ll ever truly overcome my beginnings. I tell you this because it’s one of the biggest problems facing America.

This COVID debate is driving me crazy. Mask vs anti-mask. Vaxx vs anti-vaxx. Republicans vs Democrats. Everyone vs everyone. Still a year and a half later no one is talking about how to produce healthy Americans who can fight off disease.

I’m no doctor but I know for 100% certainty that it starts with our children. I was a welfare child and looking back, I don’t remember eating anything that wasn’t processed shit. I remember eating sugar filled cereal for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I don’t ever remember eating fresh veggies or fruits. We never ate clean meat. Most meals were microwaveable TV dinners that can barely even be classified as food. Even our toothpaste was full of sugar.

As a result I’m having to spend years correcting what my mother did to me. That sounds harsh but truth be told, I don’t think she knew any better and if she did she couldn’t afford anything different. She was doing everything she could to make sure we weren’t homeless and had anything to eat at all.

Too many Americans face the same predicament. They don’t understand health because America pushes drugs and shots instead. They can’t afford real food. Many live in food deserts.

Still, too many can afford better but they’ve become Americanized into believing that drugs, shots and processed shit is okay. Being fat and sick is normal. All the while their children are always sick.

Refuse to go along with the American way of life. Cheap isn’t better. Easy isn’t better. Normal is absolutely not better.

Go get your vaccine. I really don’t care. But for the love of God give your children a better foundation than the one I got. We live in a day when you have access to the knowledge. Be different. Your children deserve it.

Anyway, here’s a cute picture of Tennyson from this weekend.

Eat, drink, screw and be happy.

Most people think Epicureanism is all about hedonism. It’s all about speaking pleasure. I mean after all, Epicurus did create the first hippy communes where people screwed all day.

This translation of Epicureanism is only partly true. Epicurus did push pleasure above all else, but pleasure in the long term sense. Eating and drinking all day will make you fat and being fat can lead to long term pain. So does fathering a bunch of children or catching diseases. So yeah, all that stuff can be pleasurable in the moment but it can lead to mental anguish and less freedom, two things that Epicurus put above all else in the search for pleasure. More than anything, Epicurus believed that pleasure can only be found when we rid ourselves of the anxiety of death, the most common of all anxieties.

I enjoyed this book in my continued journey through philosophy. There are definitely some good items here that I can adopt in my life, but not nearly as many as I find in stoicism. This is definitely a must read for anyone interested in philosophy. But unlike the writings of Seneca or Epictetus, I don’t see a lot of useful information that I would recommend to most people.

A very short book review.

CS Lewis is my favorite author and his Christian apologetic works Mere Christianity, Screwtape Letters, The Great Divorce and many more are some of my all time favorite books. Most interesting about Lewis, and why he’s such an amazing apologist, is that he was an atheist. As a former nonbeliever he is able to craft logical defenses that appeal to me rather than the emotional angles taken by many authors.

If you enjoy Lewis you will enjoy this memoir about his life from birth to his acceptance of Christ. If you aren’t a Lewis fan you will find this book rather dull and unimportant. But how could you not be a CS Lewis fan?

19134,"Stop Caring What People Think","Let me be clear - I no longer care what you think of me.

So many of us hold back because we care what everyone around us thinks. We fear embarrassment. We fear being disliked. We fear being outcasts in our community.

I’m done playing the game.

I don’t want my boys seeing me being part of this petty bullshit because I don’t want them to be a part of it either.

Let me ask you a few questions.

What did you do to be an American?

What did you do to get these liberties?

What did you do to get these rights?

The answer is nothing. You did nothing to be an American. You were lucky. Your parents hooked up here and you just happen to be born in America by some miracle. That could’ve happened anywhere. That sperm and egg could have connected in North Korea or China or Afghanistan. And you are wasting it all.

A fish doesn’t realize it’s in water. Similarly we are so used to our freedoms that don’t even realize how lucky we are. It’s amazing how out of touch we are in our comfortable little American bubbles. While people in Afghanistan are falling from airplanes because they are so desperate to leave their nation, our biggest concern is what other people think about us. Or where we are going to drink tonight. Or our delicate little feelings.

Imagine what those Afghanis would do for the opportunities we are wasting caring what other people think. It’s silly. And it’s small.
People are risking their lives for what we have and our biggest problem is that we have too much, enabling us to sit our fat asses on the couch, over consuming and getting fatter. We are so scared to get off the couch and act boldly because our neighbors may talk shit behind our backs. “What are they doing? Can you believe that? Who do think they are?”

What are we doing with the pure luck we stumbled upon? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

Two weeks ago I told you that I’m done with regret. The next step is to stop caring what other people think. These are two of many lessons my boys will learn as I figure out how to overcome our nation’s slide toward mediocrity.

Just today Facebook released it’s new virtual workspace product, Horizon Workrooms. They write “workrooms is our flagship collaboration experience that lets people come together to work in the same virtual room, regardless of physical distance.”

This is one of the first steps we will see toward a metaverse, popularized in books I have already reviewed, Snow Crash and Ready Player One, where we will live our daily lives in a computerized world. We already see many people spending time in virtual gaming worlds, such as Mindcraft, but most of these game are not yet totally immersive. Soon they will be and we will also be working, drinking with friends and even racing in virtual worlds.

Hell, I’m already close to it myself. My triathlon bike is connected to a computer where I race people around the world on a virtual course. The front of the bike is connected to a device that lifts and lowers the bike when I hit inclines and declines. The back tire is connected to a device that creates tension. A fan sits in front of the bike that blows at a rate corresponding with my speed. All I need is a virtual headset and I expect that technology to be here in the next five years.

It sounds fun, but what happens next? Where does all this virtual living lead? If we can create virtual worlds, can we replicate real people to live in those worlds? Can we scan a person’s brain and upload it to the virtual world when that person dies, thus overcoming death itself? These are the questions tackled in the sequel to Ready Player One, appropriately titled Ready Player Two.

I enjoyed this book but nowhere near as much as I enjoyed Ready Player One. It wasn’t as tech and sci-fi nerdy as the first, instead leaning more into 80s pop culture. If you’re a fan of John Hughes movies or Prince, you will probably like this book more than I did.

Still, the plot it sound and it’s a good sequel. It’s just no Empire Strikes Back. If you took the time to read Ready Player One, which you definitely should, then you should also read this book if for no other reason than to find out what happens to the characters. It’s also a good lesson to where the metaverse could take us.

19144,"A Supportive Partner is Imperative to Your Success","There are so many self help books and online experts giving advice as to how you can take your life to the next level. Nearly all of them skip over the most important piece of advice, the actual foundation for all the other advice. If you don’t get this one thing right you will absolutely fail at everything you try to do. You will fail at starting a business, building new streams of income, getting fit, crossing finish lines and pretty much everything else.

This is imperative - You must have a supportive partner.

All of this is a team sport. Any person trying to do big things must have support and not just at the office or on a race course. Physical, emotional and spiritual support starts at home. If that support isn’t there the whole plan crumbles under the weight of time and stress.

I’ve seen it. One person has big plans. The spouse is totally not on board. Not only does the plan fail but typically the marriage does too.

Today I’m in Colorado to crew and pace my political mentor as he crushes the Leadville 100, one of America’s hardest ultramarathons. Elizabeth is back home with the boys and holding down the fort alone. That’s not easy over four days. Someone take her some booze. She prefers champagne.

Really, this is nothing compared to the daily support I get when I’m back home. She helps me train for three hours a day and work around the clock. She’s there for me when I’m injured or sick or having a really tough work day when I just need someone to cry to. She tells me when an idea is stupid or when I need to change direction. She lets me know that an employee isn’t a good fit and when my focus is off. She encourages me when I’m on the right track. She’s always there to cheer me on during a race or to give me a hug when I’m completely drained. She’s the person who tells me to just stop moving and get in the bed. She even reads the Wall Street Journal and sends me clips every morning. 😀

Every accomplishment is also Elizabeth’s. And that’s how it should be in marriage. So if you want to join that new fitness program and lose weight, you better get your spouse on board. Want to create a business, invest in crypto or buy a rental property? You better get your spouse on board. Want to take your life to the next level? Get your spouse on board. It’s the foundation of every plan.

Ugh! Still about six book reviews behind. I’ve been just so slammed up recently that I have had little time to write. Let me knock this one out real quick because it was quite mind shifting for me.

It’s probably because I grew up poor, but since I started making income beyond my daily living I mostly store it away like a little squirrel storing away his nuts for the winter. My focus has been on building a nice little nest egg for retirement. Then I started building my personal wealth and my focus shifted to building generational wealth for my children.

This book makes a counter argument. We should be spending more money while we are younger because we will have more flexibility and energy to have fun. The goal of life should be to grow memories and experiences. When you are on your death bed all you have left are memories. Cash means absolutely nothing. I like that, a lot.

Additionally, why save up money for your children when they are most likely going to be older and comfortable by the time you die? Your children may want the money, but they aren’t as likely to actually need the money when they are say, 50 years old. They actually need the money when they are younger. When they are trying to buy a home or start a business.

Cash is a means to an end. It’s not the end itself.

I strongly recommend this book. It has me thinking in a completely different way.

Today seems like a great time to post this book review as we stare at the results of electing a weak President. Last week I tweeted “Joe Biden is the epitome of weakness.” Someone replied “who is the epitome of strength?” I think they were baiting me into answering “Donald Trump.” Instead I replied “Dwight D Eisenhower.”

Many Presidents exuded strength. Washington, Lincoln, Grant, Reagan and yes, Trump. Washington is obviously in a league of his own. Grant was a strong general, but he pretty much bungled being President. Eisenhower was both an amazing strategic military leader and a strong President.

The book is broken into two parts. The first tells the story of Eisenhower’s climb up through the military during wartime, culminating with his time as Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe during WW2. As a huge fan of WW2 history, this part of the book was very exciting for me.

During his transition time, which I didn’t know a lot about, Eisenhower served as President of Columbia University and then as the first Supreme Commander of NATO.

The book then transitions into his second part, the two terms of Eisenhower’s presidency. His focus on civil rights and American infrastructure as well as the establishment of NASA and a number of international incidents were all things I knew. What I didn’t know and found incredibly interesting was his very rocky relationship with Richard Nixon.
If you want to know what the complete opposite of weak Joe Biden looks like, read this book and learn about strong Dwight D Eisenhower. I love reading WW2 history and presidential bios so this book was tailor made for me. I definitely recommend.

There’s nothing new in this book other than a unique life story. Most of it is common sense advice you can find in other self improvement books. The difference is two-fold:
<ol>
 	<li>Whalen doesn’t waste your time. There’s no fluff. He’s straight to the point. Other authors write page after page of bullshit in some obvious attempt to just make their book longer. It’s infuriating. This is a quick outline that you can consume in one day. And you should.</li>
 	<li>His tone is amazing. Whalen is a no bullshit guy and he doesn’t sugarcoat anything. If you like my tone, you’ll love his tone.</li>
</ol>
If you’re going to read just one self improvement book this one is a great one to pick up. You can knock it out rapidly for a quick jolt of motivation.

Side note: follow Sean Whalen and his Lions Not Sheep movement on Insta. I want to meet this guy soon. He’s saying what I’ve been saying for years. He’s just better at it because he doesn’t have to worry about losing clients. 😉

“I'm takin' this horse by the reins making' Redcoats redder with bloodstains.”

I have been eager to read a biography of the Marquis de La Fayette since watching Hamilton. This book came out just a couple weeks ago and I was quick to snag it up and knock it out.

They call Lafayette “The Hero of Two Worlds” for fighting for liberty in both America and France. I knew a great deal about his heroic acts during the American Revolution and a bit about how he got here. However, I knew very little about his life after going back to France and his actions to establish liberty there. I also didn't know about his time in prison.

Admittedly, I know very little about French history at all. And what little I do know comes from my love of Les Miserables and some reading on the battles and rein of Napoleon Bonaparte. Perhaps once I knock out my goal of reading a biography of every US President I will turn some attention to European history.

Really, French history makes American history look rather calm and dull. Those folks seemed to have had a revolution every five years for a bit there. I was pretty surprised to read that Lafayette had the opportunity to basically become a dictator in France, had he wished. I knew that he did return to the United States during the presidency of James Monroe but I did not know he visited all 24 states.

America’s favorite fighting Frenchmen certainly lived an interesting life. All fans of history should pick up this book.

I said I was done with self help books but I have at least two more for you. This one is a must read for folks wanting to take their lives to the next level, and then the level after that. Mark Evans Dm, the Deal Maker, is my new mentor. I have recently joined his mastermind group and it’s already starting to change my life after just a couple months. Yes, there are many actionable items I am learning but the biggest takeaway is simply surrounding myself with new people who are doing much bigger things than I am. It’s truly inspiring and my brain has been on fire since meeting these men last month.

I learned something valuable in my first day with these men and it’s the ultimate lesson of this book. I learned that I do not have a business. I have a job. As Mark would say, I’m a mule. I’m working too hard day in and day out and not seeing my big dreams come true. Sure, things are going great. I have a lot of money in the bank, I’m growing my assets, I love my house and my car and I’m able to put my kids in private school. Still, I’m working my ass off and not getting to the next level. It would be like running an extra twenty miles every week but not picking up any time in a marathon. In fact, I could actually lose time by working so hard, yet so dumb.

So how do you get out of that rut and go from being a mule to making magic happen as a magician? This book gives you actionable steps to follow without all the bullshit fluff found in most books of this genre. I definitely recommend it to all of you finding yourself in my situation.

Ehhh… it was okay. Not every sequel can be Godfather II, Empire Strikes Back or Wrath of Khan. This was more Temple of Doom. Sure, eating monkey brains is cool and all but it’s not Raiders of the Lost Ark. Shit, this is a book and not a movie. Sorry.

Blue Ocean Strategy is one of my favorite business books and it’s been a real game changer for my business. I held high expectations for the sequel but it was underwhelming. Where the first focused on larger concepts, the sequel focused on the nitty gritty, the steps on how to reach those blue oceans. Many of you will need those steps so you may actually find this book more useful than the first. I just found myself bored because I have already made some big changes so this is a little late for me.

I’m not saying it’s not a good book. I found some things very useful. It just didn’t blow my socks off like the first. So yeah, read it. But don’t expect a giant boulder to roll you over. That makes no sense. You know what I mean.

It’s raining all day in Charleston today. I don’t feel like sitting on I-26 for two hours each way because people can’t drive in the rain. Instead I’m going to work from my couch. I could even sleep all day, although you know that’s not in my DNA. No one tells me where I have to be and when. No boss is telling me to get into the office or counting my sick days. My company is nearly to the point that it can run without me. I’ve spent 12 years building an operation to fund the lifestyle of my choosing.

Money. Power. Fame. So many people are chasing that bullshit as if they’re the end. That shit isn’t the end. They’re means to an end. The end is freedom. Complete and total freedom.

That’s my takeaway from, MEconomy, the most recent book by Mark Evans Dm. The subtitle is “how to control every part of your life” and that starts by taking control of yourself. Taking control of your time, your mind, your body, your finances, your family… your world. That’s how you get freedom.

Mark gives you a no bullshit, no fluff, straight to the point guide on how he designed his life for ultimate freedom and how you can too.

I recommend this book for everyone but especially those who are lost or just need a quick kick in the ass. You can knock it out in just one day so that by tomorrow you’re on your way to a new life.

Most of us are addicts and we don’t even realize it. Maybe we aren’t addicted to booze, drugs or sex so we think it’s no big deal. But the truth is too many of us are cell phone, TV, social media and news addicts. We are addicted to the dopamine hit we get every time we get a thumbs up or a news anchor validates our beliefs. I know it’s true because it’s what I do. I was at the forefront of political social media and I’ve seen how these companies have changed their platforms, and how cable news has changed, with the specific purpose of getting you addicted. The name of the game is attention and they, we, have figured out how to feed that addiction.

Unfortunately it goes so much deeper. Walk around downtown Charleston and you’ll see the college students with what I call “Adderall eyes.” The nation is finally cracking down on opioids but no one cares that the majority of Americans are walking around completely dependent on some sort of chemical. We need drugs to get up. We need drugs to get down. We need drugs just to interact with people. We tell parents that their kids have ADHD so that drug companies can get humans addicted as soon as they start kindergarten.

We are a nation completely dependent on whatever it takes to avoid the real world, be happy all the time and completely avoid pain. That’s what this book is about and it’s a real wake up call. Every single person will read this and realize they have to change something about their life. You need to pick this one up now.

I can’t finish this review without pointing out one thing I found odd. The author admits her own addiction. She was addicted to erotic novels. She says she broke the addiction. But then she uses the story of one man, a sex addict, as the foundational story of the book. This man is so addicted to masterbating that he used a record player to build his own masterbation device. Then it went further and he started hooking up electrical wires to his balls. So basically, the author in breaking her erotic addiction, wrote her own erotic novel.

Anyway, pick up this book. This nation is heading down a dark dark path and it won’t change until everyone realizes what’s happening. I, for one, am scared.

19213,"Dave Chappelle is Under Fire Again","Dave Chappelle is under fire again for his jokes about the LGTBQ+ community in his new Netflix special “The Closer.” Rather then evaluating Chappelle’s response to the continued criticism, which was the entire point of the special, it’s more appropriate to critique Netflix who has been attacked by GLAAD and criticized by its own employees.

Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos sent an internal memo to staff stating “Chappelle is one of the most popular stand-up comedians today, and we have a long standing deal with him. His last special “Sticks &amp; Stones,” also controversial, is our most watched, stickiest and most award winning stand-up special to date.”

In other words, he’s too popular to cancel and he rakes in cash for Netflix, even when he’s most controversial . From a strictly financial viewpoint, Netflix gains a lot and loses very little by aligning itself with Chappelle.

Sarandos continued “As with our other talent, we work hard to support their creative freedom — even though this means there will always be content on Netflix some people believe is harmful.”

That’s a strong line. Comedy is a big part of Netflix’s strategy and many, if not most, of the specials are full of offensive commentary. To delete Chappelle, the GOAT, is to delete them all and a large portion of Netflix’s appeal.

He added “Several of you have also asked where we draw the line on hate. We don’t allow titles Netflix that are designed to incite hate or violence, and we don’t believe ‘The Closer’ crosses that line.”

This is a reassuring statement to staff letting them know that content is reviewed and analyzed before simply positing. Netflix bosses understand that in Chappelle’s style of comedy each joke is just one step in the path to a greater lesson, in this case one about empathy.

The professional critics are hating on “The Closer” giving it a rating of 33% on Rotten tomatoes. One Forbes headline reads “Dave Chappelle’s ‘The Closer’ Paints A Sad Portrait Of A Declining Comedian.” This is proof positive that mainstream media critics are out of touch with every day Americans as the public has given the special a rating of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. It’s also proof that the public is more aligned with Netflix than they are it’s critics.

I’m not here to argue the morality of Netflix’s decision or the appropriateness of Chappelle’s jokes. Our podcast and my upcoming book is about the controversy and the response. In that vein Netflix’s response to the Chappelle controversy is strong which means they were obviously prepared for the backlash. How could they not be? They knew exactly what Chappelle was saying before they posted the video. They knew where the attacks would come from. They knew how to respond. This is a textbook example of being prepared for the fight.

19216,"Everything you put in an electronic format can and will be used against you in the future","As I’m sitting here working on my book a news alert just popped on my phone stating “Raiders Coach Resigns After Homophobic and Misogynistic Emails.”

The quick summary is that old emails, some as old as ten years, were uncovered in which coach John Gruden, according to USA Today, “used a homophobic slur to describe NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, denigrated one team's decision to draft a gay player, mocked transgender woman Caitlyn Jenner, deprecated female referees and suggested that a player who kneeled during the national anthem should be fired.”

Given that these emails were sent years ago while Gruden worked for ESPN and before he worked for the NFL, there are a couple crisis communications lessons from my upcoming book worth noting.

First, a simple piece of advice that I give students every time I’m asked to speak to a class. Everything you put in an electronic format, like email or social posts, can and will be used against you in the future. It’s best to keep the offensive stuff in your head. For stuff that could be taken the wrong way, pick up the phone. When drinking, don’t post or send anything.

Second, always do research on a potential leader in your organization. You probably know that in political campaigns we do a lot of opposition research. All those negative ads you see on TV start out as notes in a large binder of documents compiled by a researcher. Everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING, about a person is in these binder. What you probably don’t know is that we do the same for our candidates too. Going into a campaign we have to know as much, even more, about our guy as the other guy. We must know all the threats. And we must know how hard those threats hit. Only then can we be prepared. Corporations must do the exact same.

The Raiders organization should have been prepared for the onslaught of bad press they’ve received in the last two weeks. They weren’t and as a result they look foolish and Gruden’s professional life is ruined forever.

19221,"Live free and Let Die Book Review","<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Live-Let-Die-James-Bond/dp/1612185444/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=live+and+let+die&amp;qid=1638990308&amp;sr=8-3"">Live and Let Die - Ian Fleming</a>

It’s a busy day so I’ll have to drop a short review of Ian Fleming’s second James Bond book “Live and Let Die.” First off, a warning. This book was written in a different time and would definitely be considered racist today. Bond spends most of the book in either Harlem or Jamaica and the supporting characters are nearly all black. The descriptions of these characters are pretty offensive and that’s coming from me who writes daily on how overly sensitive our culture has become. This is different, like way different, like comparing black people to apes different. It’s cringeworthy as hell. If you can get past the word “negro” on every page, this is a fun spy novel. I enjoyed it as much as I did Casino Royale.

It’s also important to note that the book is completely different than the movie starring Roger Moore. While the characters are the same, the plot is incredibly different.

Live and Let Die is a quick read and if you’re a Bond fan you should read it. I enjoyed it enough to continue my journey through Fleming’s novels. I just don’t know if I will stay in order because Moonraker is next and it’s a really shitty movie. Sci Fi and James Bond don’t mix. But I’m intrigued because the book was written in the 50s and we didn’t even step foot on the moon until 1969. So maybe I do move on to Moonraker next just to see how this is done.

19224,"Don't focus on getting rich. Focus on living rich.","<div dir=""auto"">I’ve read 152 books in the last twenty-one months. Some I put down and have never thought of again. Some changed my daily habits. A few fundamentally blew my mind and changed my life. One of the latter was Die With Zero by Bill Perkins and I haven’t been able to get his words out of my mind in the last month.</div>
<div dir=""auto""></div>
<div dir=""auto"">The premise is simple - don’t focus on getting rich. Focus on living rich. Don’t accumulate a lot of wealth that you will never use. Don’t be on your death bed with millions of dollars. Use all the resources at your disposal now to have the most fulfilling life possible.</div>
<div dir=""auto""></div>
<div dir=""auto"">The immediate question is “what about the kids?” Coming from a background of poverty, creating generational wealth for my kids is very appealing. Perkins argues that we should give our children huge experiences when they are young so that we are shaping their minds in different ways. I’m starting to lean that way. It’s said that “travel is the best education” and “travel is one of few things you can spend money on that makes you richer.” So if you spend money showing your kids the world, they will become better educated humans able to build more fulfilling lives for themselves and others.</div>
<div dir=""auto""></div>
<div dir=""auto"">Harlowe has been to Paris twice, Tennyson once. Both talk about it every day. It has already fundamentally changed their perspectives on the world because they see how big the world is, something I didn’t see until my twenties.</div>
<div dir=""auto""></div>
<div dir=""auto"">I’ve already reviewed this book for you once. The fact that I’m going back to it today means you really should pick it up.</div>

Ahead of the release of No Time To Die, Elizabeth and I are rewatching the Daniel Craig 007 movies. This week I realized I’ve never actually read one of Ian Fleming’s books so I decided to pick up the first one, Casino Royale.

While many of the details are different than the movie, the main plot points remain the same. I always enjoy the book versions because you are able to get inside the characters’ heads in a way not allowed by a movie. This one was even more fascinating because James Bond is one of my all time favorite characters and the book provides a complete new side to him I had not seen before.

Casino Royale is a short fast read that I recommend to all Bond fans. I’m not saying that I’m going to read all the Bond books, but after finishing this book I immediately ordered Live and Let Die.",,2021-10-14,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/casino-royale-book-review/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211014_Wesley-Donehue_BlogCovers_Casino-Royale.png,"211014_Wesley Donehue_BlogCovers_Casino Royale",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211014_Wesley-Donehue_BlogCovers_Casino-Royale.png,,"Book Reviews",,publish,6,lianasarapas,liana@pushdigital.com,Liana,Sarapas,casino-royale-book-review,,,0,0,0,open,open,2021-12-08
19230,"Runner's High Book Review","<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Runners-High-Movement-Cannabis-Fueled-Athletes/dp/059319117X/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=runner%27s+high&amp;qid=1638990124&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2"">Runner's High: How a Movement of Cannabis-Fueled Athletes Is Changing the Science of Sports - Josiah Hesse</a>

Do you run? Do you smoke weed? Maybe you should try both at the same time. That’s the simple premise of this book.

Hesse dives deep into the use of weed in all athletics but focuses intensely on the running community with an emphasis on ultra running. He provides a well researched analysis of pot culture through history and a political explanation of how weed became a stigma, became illegal and now is becoming legal across the nation.

I really enjoyed this book but I must warn all my conservative friends here that Hesse is a huge liberal. He appropriately puts a lot of blame on conservatives for the hypocritical ban on weed, especially when compared to the poison being pumped out by pharmaceutical companies, like the one that killed my mother. However, he has a tendency to go a bit overboard in his obvious disdain for Republicans. I cannot blame him on this particular issue.

Still, I really liked this book. I often smelled weed on wooded running trails and even during races. I’ve always wondered what it would be like to get high before a run or race. I have yet to do so because well, I don’t do illegal things. I’m a responsible parent and entrepreneur after all.",,2021-10-14,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/runners-high-book-review/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211014_Wesley-Donehue_BlogCovers_Runners-High.png,"211014_Wesley Donehue_BlogCovers_Runner's High",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/211014_Wesley-Donehue_BlogCovers_Runners-High.png,,"Book Reviews",,publish,6,lianasarapas,liana@pushdigital.com,Liana,Sarapas,runners-high-book-review,,,0,0,0,open,open,2021-12-08

19264,"How To Get Focused On What Really Matters","My biggest fault as an entrepreneur and a leader is that I get too bogged down in shit I should never touch. I allow myself to get caught up in the emotions of client work and the drama that comes with having a big team. Truth be told, I give too many Fs.

That’s been the case over the last three months. It happens a lot in non-election years. The actual work, which I love, slows down. We are forced to hit the road to recruit new clients. We take a step back and reshuffle our priorities, our direction and our team. It means I have to get in the weeds.

Except no, I don’t have to. I’ve built a badass team and a company that can mostly run without me. So I don’t have to, but I do anyway and it just exacerbates every issue. We always do better as a company when I personally give less Fs. So that’s what I’m doing. And that’s why I picked up <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/dp/0062457713/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2MM8XD1FL262&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=subtle+art+of+not+giving+a+f&amp;qid=1634592422&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"">The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F</a> by Mark Manson again, after reading it two years ago, as a reminder.

The key isn’t to give no Fs. The key is to become hyper focused on what I do best and what really grows the company and our income. That means giving less Fs about dumb shit and more Fs about a few important things. This book should be called “How To Get Focused On What Matters,” but that isn’t nearly as catchy.

If you allow yourself to get all worked up about dumb shit like I do then you need to read this book.

19270,"What should Southwest Airlines do?","What should Southwest Airlines do? They are the big public relations loser of the week due to massive cancelations, up to 25%, for five straight days.

In a statement released yesterday CEO Van de Ven stated:

""The operational disruption began on Friday and was initially created by weather and air traffic constraints that stalled our Florida operations for many hours. As a result, our aircraft and Crews were not in their pre-planned positions to operate our schedule on Saturday. Unfortunately, the out-of-place aircraft and Crew resources created additional cancelations across our point-to-point network that cascaded throughout the weekend and into Monday and Tuesday. Weather and air traffic constraints were not an issue beyond Friday, but it took us several days to re-set our network after the initial challenges.”

Ok, that seems like a valid explanation. It’s not one to pacify pissed off passengers sitting in airports, but it seems factual, logical and transparent. Just a few problems:

1. The FAA counters the claim stating there have been no traffic shortages.

2. No other airlines suffered these type issues due to weather.

3. The delays occurred immediately after the pilot’s union asked the courts to block a vaccination mandate by the company.

4. Numerous pilots took to social media claiming they stayed home due to the mandate.

5. The pilots union earlier this week claimed that the issue was not due to vaccine mandates but because of a computer issue they’ve been warning of for years.

All to say the airline, FAA, union and individual pilots are all stating different things which makes it look horrible for Southwest. It all plays against a political backdrop dominated by vaccine debates. Conservatives have taken to social media, where my agency focuses, to use Southwest as an example - this is what happens when you take away health decisions from your employees.

I’m gonna be honest. This is a very hard one to tackle because there is a whole lot going on here that would take pages to explain and solve. There’s much to be said about the political dynamics but what I find most unique to this situation is how all the different players are saying different things and sniping at each other.

I see this happen on a lot of political campaigns. The shit hits the fan and everyone on the team starts playing the blame game. Instead of firing out of the foxhole everyone starts firing at each other for individual survival or to gain some sort of perceived power. The solution is to tackle the issue before it becomes a problem by building a team with a zero tolerance policy for sniping or drama. Everyone must be singing off the same song sheet.

That’s much easier in a smaller operation and exceedingly difficult in larger companies, but it can be done. Obviously in this case you can’t necessarily dictate what the FAA says but the company could get the union and the pilots on the same page. Even if they don’t agree on a resolution, they can and should at least be on the same page as to the problem itself. That would provide a foundation for complete transparency rather than what’s happening now where everyone looks shady and like a bunch of liars while customers get more and more pissed off. Customers are going to be pissed for the delays and cancellations but they will be on fire when they’re not getting the honest truth. While the company and the union may be at odds, losing a bunch of customers hurts both. It just doesn’t make sense that they cannot agree on the problem, much less a solution.

This story shows a lack of leadership at Southwest. Yes it’s hard to maneuver through the vaccine mandates but that should not cause this kind of messaging disarray. Whether it’s the weather, computer issues or the mandates, everyone at a minimum should be on the same page as to the problem. The fact that they are not highlights a bunch of internal turmoil beyond this specific instance.

19274,"Facebook is changing it’s name and why that matters to you","News broke that Facebook will be changing the name of it’s parent company to better reflect Mark Zuckerberg’s desire to be the creator of the metaverse.

Named after the virtual world of Snowcrash and popularized I’m Ready Player One, the metaverse is the virtual world we will all be living in within the next twenty years.

I’ve been talking about this for years and people called me crazy. Just like the big TV firms called me crazy when I said digital would overtake TV because TV would become digital.

“No, you’re crazy. I won’t be doing that.” Yeah just like you don’t spend hours a day on Facebook or kids don’t live their lives on Minecraft.

Ten years from now you will be spending hours every day, if not the majority of your day, in a virtual world - the metaverse.

You will have a virtual office, home and place to hang out with your friends.

NFTs are an early step. It’s art you will take with you into the metaverse.

And yes, I’ll be pushing political advertising to you, specifically to you the individual, in the metaverse.

Today I’ll spend two hours on a bike inside my home. I’ll ride a virtual course on a computer screen. My back tire is on a trainer that creates tension based on the landscape of the course. The front of the bike is connected to a device that inclines and declines my position based on the grade. A fan sits in front of me that blows based on the speed I’m riding. I’m nearly training for a full Ironman in a virtual world. All I need are goggles that show me my complete surroundings and I will be there. That’s coming in the next few years.

Then it’s the office. Then it’s life.

The future is coming.

19282,"A politician isn’t coming to save you","If we can just get Joe Biden re-elected.

Let’s Go Brandon!

If we can just take back the Senate.

MAGA!

It’s simply amazing to me how many people are waiting for a savior. They sit in front of Fox News or CNN all day obsessed over the power struggle as if their lives will fundamentally change if some politician is elected.

Let me give you guys a wake up call as someone who is deeply entrenched in the political game – NO ONE IS COMING TO SAVE YOU!

Yes, it’s true that some politicians may make it easier for you to succeed. They may lower taxes and reduce regulation. They may make it easier to run a business. But no politician is going to legislate you to prosperity or happiness.

That shits on you!

What the hell are you doing obsessing over all this political bullshit? Why are you waiting? Why aren’t you making moves?

The answer is pretty simple. It’s easier to blame politicians than to blame yourself. It’s easier to yell at the ladies of The View, praise Tucker Carlson or get into a Facebook argument than it is to take ownership of your own life.

We’re given one life to live with limited time. Once a day has passed that day is gone. It’s never coming back. That chance for action is never coming back. That hour watching Fox News is gone.

There’s only one savior and I promise you He doesn’t seek elected office. Until He returns you have to think for yourself, act for yourself and succeed for yourself.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">AND I’M IN POLITICS!! if anyone should understand the world, it’s me.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But politics is bullshit. It’s about power. Or really, perceived power. A perceived power that’s always, ALWAYS, fleeting. The powerful committee chair today is a paid lobbyist begging for favors tomorrow. I recently learned that one politician in South Carolina, who was one of the most powerful in our state for decades, now spends much of his days scrubbing urinals.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Real power is in the money. The wealthy rule the world. They did before the current politician and they will after.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The problem is the most of us don’t understand money. We are completely ignorant. We truly don’t understand global economics, taxes, government spending, banking, the stock market or crypto. We can’t even answer the simple question - what is money?</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Why? Because our education system is built to keep us in the dark. We are supposed to be sheep.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Two years ago I decided to educate myself. I’ve watched hundreds of videos, listened to hundreds of podcasts, read over 150 books and taken multiple courses. Still I haven’t scratched the surface. I’m still ignorant.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Friends, every finish line comes with massive failure. Every dollar made comes with staff quitting and clients leaving that breaks my heart and makes me want to ball up in a corner and cry. Still I keep moving.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m a massive failure. And that’s how I succeed. Don’t let these fake ass Insta bullshitters convince you that you’re not good enough. You are capable of so much more than you realize. Just get out there and take massive action. </span>

19327,"Choosing The Right Ad Mix For You","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Where should you advertise? Here’s your answer.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m contacted a few times each week by friends or people who have found me online asking specifically where they should advertise - TV, mail, digital, etc. The answer is that it completely depends on your audience.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are common themes and big messages that resonate with a large swath of the population. These can be formatted into ads delivered across mass media such as television, radio or billboards, or across all digital channels. Basically, places where everyone sees them, a shotgun approach that provides a large bang for the buck. Think McDonald’s. Everyone loves cheeseburgers so their audience is everyone. Mass media makes sense for them.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are more specific themes that resonate with a more specific audience, say women and cosmetics. These ads can be placed on mass media platforms such as television, but should be targeted to channels and shows watched mostly by females, or in female targeted publications such as Cosmo. In today’s media environment the most optimal platforms to place these ads are digital because of the ability to receive instant feedback on performance, allowing you to change and perfect messaging, creative and targets. We call this optimization.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lastly there are very specific messages for niche audiences. These messages are best delivered over digital channels or perhaps in the mailbox. Aside from Runner’s World magazine, there isn’t a great way to reach a small audience such as marathoners. Or Star Trek fans. This is where you really utilize digital. You can get insanely granular using millions or data points. Want to reach 41 year old white dudes who run marathons, love Star Trek, listen to the Wu Tang clan, have three children and run marathons? Yeah, me. You reach me across digital platforms. Good luck coming up with that creative.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The best media plans use a little bit of each, which is called a media mix. Lets look at a political campaign as an example because that’s where we are the best in the nation.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We are a converged media company, meaning we do marketing across all platforms. We may have five big television ads in rotation across different media markets across a state with big messages that resonate with everyone, ie this guy is an honest and ethical family man. Then we may have 200 niche ads running across digital platforms, including connected televisions, targeting pro-lifers, gun owners, hard fiscal conservatives, moderates, moms, and many many more audiences.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the current iteration of the internet, referred to as Web 2.0, we are hyper focused on media mixes based on television, connected television and all digital platforms.

19330,"Brain Fog","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Where are the book reviews?</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There’s a good reason the book reviews have slowed down. It’s because the reading has slowed down. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A lot of people talk about the physical exhaustion that comes with training for endurance events. Rarely do people talk about the mental exhaustion. I’ve reached the point when mental fog weighs heavy in my head.  Just looking at a page hurts my brain. I’ve repeatedly read pages and then asked myself “what the hell did I just read?” Listening is no better.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Currently I’m in the middle of a few books:</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Bitcoin Standard</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Almanack of Naval Ravikant</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dune</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dreamland</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How Will You Measure Your Life?</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Moonraker</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Propaganda </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Swamp Fox</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I have a stack of at least 20 books sitting behind those. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now that I have passed the last big weekend of training and I’m entering the taper phase with just ten days before the big Ironman in Cozumel, I’m hoping that the brain fog clears so that I’m able to bring you some new reviews.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the meantime I would like to know what you’re looking for. The two questions I get asked the most on a daily basis are:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How do I get started with cryptocurrency?</span></li>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> What books should I read?</span></li>
</ol>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ignore #1 for now and lets focus on the books. What do you want?  Just a list of my favorites? Best business books? Best books to read drinking beers on a beach?</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let me know and I will work on some lists when the brain fog clears.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I hope you have a phenomenal day full of Positive Vibes!</span>

19334,"The Metaverse Is Coming Soon","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Last week news broke that Nike has filed seven trademark applications to sell virtual shoes as it prepares to enter the metaverse. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is no longer just something nerds like me are talking about, or have been talking for years. This was always going to be Web 3.0. The Covid pandemic just sped it all up a few years because everything in our lives, from work to happy hours, became virtual in 2021.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You’re going to see me writing a lot about Web 3.0 because it’s been a passion of mine and now that everyone is talking about it, a lot of you are hitting me up with questions. To answer any of them you first have to understand exactly what Web 3.0 is.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The first website, pictured above, was launched in 1991. It was just text on a screen. That’s Web 1.0. Can you believe we’ve come so far in just twenty years? That’s what you have to know about digital technology. There isn’t a linear progression. It’s a compounding progression. Every advancement speeds up the next advancement. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Web 2.0 is what we have now. There’s lots of interaction and it’s dominated mostly by user generated content on mobile devices and accessed through apps.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let’s pause for a second and talk about ownership. This is something that should and will be a separate post but we must skim across it to understand Web 3.0. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In Web 2.0 you don’t own anything, other than perhaps a domain name. You upload content to Insta and TikTok but you don’t actually own the content. You’ve given it away. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Most people look at Web 3.0 as virtual reality, but really it’s where virtual reality meets ownership. Or more specifically, where VR meets blockchain. Companies like Facebook or Epic Games may build the virtual world, but you will own the things in that world, like those Nikes mentioned above or the NFTs you keep hearing about. You will own land, buildings, art and purses. Yes purses. Louis Vuitton is already making moves for the metaverse. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You will own part of the internet because of blockchain. Think of it like this - God created the world but you own your house and your car. Oh no, did I just compare Mark Zuckerberg to God?</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is very important. You will be spending a large part of your day in a virtual world that will have actual ownership, thus a robust economy. That economy will completely disrupt the economy of the real world, making them inseparable. And if you’re a marketer or campaign hack like me, you best believe that much of your campaigning will happen in that virtual world.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I know, you’re rolling your eyes right now thinking “yeah, right.” And I’m rolling my eyes right now thinking “that’s what you said when I told you that you’ll be campaigning on Facebook.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Much more on this topic in the coming weeks.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Like a few other “books” I’ve reviewed, this one is too short to even classify as a book. However, it’s also super important so I do want to review and recommend.  </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Turning The Flywheel can be better classified as a companion to Jim Collins’ masterpiece Good to Great. In Good to Great, Collins explains the flywheel concept. Here he dives in much deeper:</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Picture a huge, heavy flywheel—a massive metal disk mounted horizontally on an axle, about 30 feet in diameter, 2 feet thick, and weighing about 5,000 pounds. Now imagine that your task is to get the flywheel rotating on the axle as fast and long as possible.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Pushing with great effort, you get the flywheel to inch forward, moving almost imperceptibly at first. You keep pushing and, after two or three hours of persistent effort, you get the flywheel to complete one entire turn.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“You keep pushing, and the flywheel begins to move a bit faster, and with continued great effort, you move it around a second rotation. You keep pushing in a consistent direction. Three turns … four … five … six … the flywheel builds up speed … seven … eight … you keep pushing … nine … ten … it builds momentum … eleven … twelve … moving faster with each turn … twenty … thirty … fifty … a hundred.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Then, at some point—breakthrough! The momentum of the thing kicks in your favor, hurling the flywheel forward, turn after turn … whoosh! … its own heavy weight working for you. You’re pushing no harder than during the first rotation, but the flywheel goes faster and faster. Each turn of the flywheel builds upon work done earlier, compounding your investment of effort. A thousand times faster, then ten thousand, then a hundred thousand. The huge heavy disk flies forward, with almost unstoppable momentum.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“A flywheel is an underlying, compelling logic of momentum … there’s an inevitability built in. If you do A, you almost can’t help but do B. And if you do B, you almost can’t help but do C. And if you do C, you almost can’t help but do D. And around and around. And it’s driven around because there’s an underlying connection. There’s a logical sequence that builds dynamic momentum, because A drives B drives C drives D and around back to the top of the loop.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“The key is you build it over a long period of time. The power of a flywheel is that it’s an underlying logic, it’s an underlying architecture.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Collins dives into how many companies, including Amazon, have created their flywheel.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Good to Great is a top five must read for every entrepreneur. This companion is a must read immediately after.</span>

19341,"Advice For Political Staffers","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“For over a thousand years Roman conquerors returning from the wars enjoyed the honor of triumph, a tumultuous parade. In the procession came trumpeteers, musicians and strange animals from conquered territories, together with carts laden with treasure and captured armaments. The conquerors rode in a triumphal chariot, the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him. Sometimes his children robed in white stood with him in the chariot or rode the trace horses. A slave stood behind the conqueror holding a golden crown and whispering in his ear a warning: that all glory is fleeting.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> ⁃ General George S. Patton</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The slave should have also been whispering in the ears of the conqueror’s assistants as they are even more likely to fall victim to the praise of the crowd. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Today they are the gatekeepers. Tomorrow they are the beggars.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If there is but one piece of advice I can give to political staffers it’s this. Whether they are working on a campaign or in a legislative or executive office I find that political staffers often forget that they are simply a wagon hitched to a horse and not the horse itself. Without that horse they are stagnant. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If glory is fleeting for the horse and the horse is creating all the movement, what do you think happens to the wagon? </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It simply sits and rots.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How political staffers treat people while they are the gatekeeper determines what happens when they are no longer hitched to the conquer. They could be picked up by the next conquer or they can be left to rot. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Far too often we see political staffers walk around Washington or campaign events like they are the most important person in the world. “I work for so and so” we hear. Yeah, but so and so won’t always be there. Then what? You won’t always have that power because the power isn’t even with you today.  </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How you treat people when you yield the power given to you by the fleeting politician determines how you will be treated when that politician is gone. You will be loved or you will be despised. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I suggest finding someone to whisper “glory is fleeting” in your ear a few times each week. Post it on your fridge. Tattoo it on your arm.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I have so much.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A beautiful, smart, driven and giving wife. Three awesome boys who are everything to me.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A gorgeous home. The car I wanted. Money in the bank, the market, real estate and crypto.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Multiple successful businesses producing positive cashflow and badass teams running them.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The ability to travel the world and do stupid endurance events.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I could go on but it would sound braggy and douchey and that’s not the point of this post. The point is that I’ve come a long way from that Section 8 housing in North Charleston. That’s called the Gain. It’s where we started to where we are now and all the great achievements in between.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When we focus on the Gain and how much we have achieved we are in a better mental space because we are so much more grateful for what we have.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unfortunately that’s now where most of us are. We are in the Gap. That’s when we focus on where we are today compared to all the things we want. We become dissatisfied with our lives because we are focused on what we do not have.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That’s not to say we shouldn’t have big goals. The problem is that we get into this comparison game with others and we start thinking that our lives suck because we don’t have what they have. Social media, and especially Instagram, have made this all so much worse.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With complete honesty and transparency, that’s me. I live in the Gap. I compare myself to my competitors or other entrepreneurs like the ballers in my mastermind group and I start losing confidence. I ask myself why I’m not killing it like them. Why am I not printing cash, bringing home $1 Million every month, buying a yacht, flying private and driving a Ferrari?</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What I really need to do is take a step back and ask myself where those guys started compared to where I started. Did they grow up on welfare and live in single wide trailers with holes in the floor? Did they grow up in a violent home with addicts? Maybe they did but I’m guessing it wasn’t many of them. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even then, why does it matter where they came from? Thats when I have to take yet another step back and realize the only thing that matters is me. I should be comparing ME to ME only. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When I do that I realize HOLY SHIT, life is absolutely AMAZING! Look what I have! Look what I’m doing! I’m hopping on a plane with my family in just two days to do a full Ironman in Cozumel!!! I’m living the freaking dream. I’m in a place I never thought I would be. Anything from here on out is just icing on a badass cake.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And just like that my mind goes from being unsatisfied to satisfied. From pessimistic to optimistic. From depressed to excited. That’s the difference between living in the Gap and in the Gain.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I strongly recommend this book to everyone. It’s a real mental game changer. </span>

19351,"All You Have To Do Is Not Suck","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m writing this from a flight to Mexico where I will take on my second full Ironman triathlon. I do so without my tri kit, the little outfit we wear for all three disciplines - swim, bike and run. I ordered the kit from Love The Pain, which as far as I can tell, produces the coolest looking triathlon and cycling gear available. The expensive price tag of $400 would make you think that Love The Pain would have amazing customer service, especially since their product is used for specific events on exact dates. My experience with the company was anything but awesome and should be used as a teachable moment for all entrepreneurs during these “uncertain times.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is true that businesses around the world are facing both staffing shortages and supply chain issues due to the Covid pandemic, or rather, government’s horrible reaction to the pandemic. While this is a criticism of the US government, it’s not one of our government alone. Nations around the world have shut down factories, creating a global supply chain issue. Here in America we have passed out money for people not to work, making many to retire early and others left asking “why work at all?” As the co-owner of a brewery, I can tell you that I have directly felt both the supply chain and staffing issues in our business. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">These challenges give business owners a choice. They can make excuses or they can step up and deliver exceptional service. No, scratch that. In 2021 businesses don’t even need to deliver exceptional service. They just need to do the basics and deliver the expected service. They just have to do the bare minimum.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The bare minimum isn’t something a business should strive for, but it highlights how horrible customer service has become across many verticals. Turn on the news for 30 minutes today and you will hear that Thanksgiving dinner will cost more than ever and you better have already ordered your Christmas gifts because they will likely be stuck on ships for weeks. The situation is no better locally when you try to go out for dinner or order an Uber. Everything takes longer. Everything is more expensive, if you can get it at all.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And because it’s so bad, entrepreneurs have an opportunity to succeed that they may never get again. Customers are so frustrated that have become exceptionally happy to just receive what they are promised. Some things will be out of a business owners control. They can’t create supplies in a Star Trek style replicator and those robots we’ve been promised for decades aren’t here yet to cook your food. That means business owners have to deliver exceptional service where they can.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Back to my story. I ordered my tri kit six weeks ago with the understanding, because of warnings on their website, that orders were taking about two weeks longer than normal. Two weeks ago I received the bottom half of my kit. I didn’t freak out. Last week I contacted the company and explained that I was leaving for my event on the 18th. They said “your order is done and should arrive on time.” </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Friday I still had not received my kit top so I contacted them again asking if I could pay to have it overnighted. You would think that would be something they would offer me. Nope, that was my idea after they offered absolutely no horrible solution. I literally messaged them “what do I have to pay to get this done.” They responded “contact us on Monday and we will see.” Yeah, “we will see” isn’t quite the service I was expecting. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So I contacted them Monday and they said if I paid $150 they would ensure it’s done and overnighted. I paid, putting my total for a triathlon kit to $550. Crazy, right. I expected the kit to be sent to USPS, FedEx or UPS the next morning. I heard nothing on Tuesday. I woke up Wednesday with an alert that the kit was shipped overnight but dropped off after the overnight cutoff time on Tuesday. That means I wouldn’t receive the kit until Thursday, after I leave for Mexico.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I contacted Love The Pain yesterday and politely told them that they dropped the ball. They responded “Thank you but we are doing great. Staffing shortages and supply chain issues can’t be avoided.” I agreed, so I responded “I simply expect you to do what you said you would do.”  </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Covid pandemic has created a problem, a big problem. It has given companies like Love The Pain an excuse to deliver shitty service. All a company has to do is say “Covid” and we are expected to understand. In this case, the kit was produced and sitting in their shop. They simply didn’t put it in the mail even after I paid $150. This isn’t a supply chain or a staffing shortage. This was a work ethic issue. This was a dropped ball, a failure to deliver on a promise.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While Love The Pain did screw me over, I should take part of the blame. I should have researched the company more. Had I done so I would have seen the hundreds of complaints to the Better Business Bureau. I guess I’m just not used to having to research companies. I just expect them to do what they say they’re going to do.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Don’t let that be you. If your business has been impacted by Covid, just be honest with your customers. But be totally honest. Tell them how you can help them. Go above and beyond to help them. Then just deliver on your promises. That’s it. People will understand, especially when you voice that you too are frustrated. Just don’t be that business, like so many businesses right now, that are just using Covid as an excuse to be lazy. Instead use Covid as an opportunity. If everyone else is sucking, all you have to do is not suck. It’s a low bar, but that’s where we are in 2021.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I even have a crypto coach and a market advisor.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I had an idea a couple years back. Instead of asking HOW to do something I started asking myself WHO can help me with this. When I started reading and watching everything I could about business, finance and fitness I quickly realized that I don’t have enough hours in the day. That’s not to say I’m going to stop teaching myself, which I obviously have not. I just wanted to move quicker than my time would allow so I needed to find experts who could help me. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That’s what this entire premise of this book. Instead of asking HOW to do something, ask yourself WHO can help you. That may be coaches or teammates or outside vendors. It’s not limited to work. Hiring someone to do your lawn or clean your home frees you up to do things that you’re good at or things you just want to do. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I was already in this headspace but had I not been this book would have been a gamechanger for me. Instead it was just affirmation that I’m on the right track. I highly recommend this book to you.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I have a job. Actually, I have a few of them. I’m the leader of Push Digital and Laurens Group. I am an investor in Frothy Beard Brewing and a couple other companies. I am the owner of a short term rental company. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But those are not my most important jobs. I am the head of my household. I am the provider, protector and teacher of three boys. I am a supportive husband. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yesterday I listened to a podcast by Mark Evans DM in which he said his purpose is to “change the direction of my family tree.” I love that so much and I may adopt it as my purpose. That’s what I’ve been focused on. Mark just said it better. The problem is that in doing so, and I’m speaking only for myself here, the focus immediately goes to money. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To truly change the direction of my family tree I need to focus on more, on all my jobs. Some call it work/life balance. I prefer to call it work/life integration. Balance can never truly be achieved. I’m not even sure what the appropriate percentages are. What I do know is that while focusing on wealth creation I must also be focused on teaching my boys ethics, integrity, honor and strength. I have to help my wife chase her dreams. I have to help move my community forward. I have to do so much.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The books answers the question “how will you measure your life” by pushing professionals toward focusing on all their jobs and not just the one that produces income. Only then can one find true happiness.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I enjoyed this book and recommend it to entrepreneurs. It’s a simple reminder that we are building businesses and wealth for a reason. It’s for our lifestyles, our happiness and our families. The wealth is not the end. It’s the means to an end.</span>

I don’t know how to write this review because the life, or rather the death, of Anthony Bourdain says so much about our world and life in general.

On the day Bourdain died I asked on Facebook “what does it say about the meaning of life when the person you most envy kills themselves?”

It’s no exaggeration to say that Bourdain’s death shook me. It still does. I was obsessed with the man. I often respond with the cheesy line “I’m living the dream” when asked how I’m doing. Bourdain literally did. Or so I thought. And that’s what I wanted.

I look back at past social posts and I see that I used to always travel in Bourdain’s footsteps. I’ve watched every episode of A Cook’s Tour, No Reservations, The Layover and Parts Unknown multiple times. Kitchen Confidential is one of my top ten favorite books. My posts show that I’ve visited London, Paris, Istanbul, Lisbon, New York, San Francisco, Austin, New York and Nashville all through his stops and those are just the ones I posted about.

I’ve long said that I shouldn’t be chasing money. I should be chasing experiences. But if the man who had all the best experiences hates his life, what does that say about my aspirations? What does it say about my definition of cool or success?

This book, more than anything, showed me that it’s in our definition of experience. The experience isn’t just about traveling to awesome places and eating amazing food. The experience isn’t even about an individual day or trip. The experience is life and not just a part of life. It’s everything.

Sure, it’s visiting amazing places but it’s also about relationships and family. It’s about people. Perhaps the more Bourdain traveled the more he realized how empty his life really was. What does it mean to see everything if you see it alone?

This review is my most unsatisfactory one yet because I want to write an entire essay on this topic and don’t have the time or space now. I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to anyone who is as obsessed with Anthony Bourdain as I have been. It’s not written like a traditional biography. It is an oral history so each story comes from multiple voices. I enjoyed that even more.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m not exaggerating when I say that every single day someone tells me “I can’t do that.” I’m not even talking about marathons or triathlons. I’m talking about maintaining basic fitness. I’ve heard every single excuse imaginable. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Still, heart disease and obesity related illnesses continue to be the number one killer in the nation.

It’s a temporary solution, not your permanent fix. It simply gives you an excuse to ignore the underlying problem killing you and this nation.</span>

19388,"The Goal Is To Beat Yourself and No One Else","In this picture I’m asking Elizabeth “did you see my swim time?” As you can see from the smile on my face I was full of joy.

Now that I look back at my time I see that out of 310 men in my age group I was 302nd out of the water. That’s the bottom 3%. <span class=""pq6dq46d tbxw36s4 knj5qynh kvgmc6g5 ditlmg2l oygrvhab nvdbi5me sf5mxxl7 gl3lb2sf hhz5lgdu""><img src=""https://www.facebook.com/images/emoji.php/v9/t34/2/16/1f629.png"" alt=""😩"" width=""16"" height=""16"" /></span>

When I tell people that my hobby is endurance races they almost always say “I can never do that.”

Guys, if I can make it out of the water, even in damn near last place, you can do “impossible” shit too. Don’t lessen yourself. You are capable of so much more.

Just five years ago I didn’t know how to swim.It wasn’t just that I couldn’t swim. I was scared to swim. The thought of swimming 2.4 miles in an open ocean scared the shit out of me. Then I just did the work to train my body and my mind.

I’m a middle of the pack athlete and I’m okay with that. My goal is to get better each year. I’m only in competition with myself.

Yeah it’s a bit embarrassing to come out of the water so near the end but guess what… I came out of the water. That would have been impossible just a few years ago.

So yeah, that big thing might be impossible for you today. That doesn’t mean it has to be impossible next year. You just have to do the work. I really hope you do.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Swim: l just can’t believe it. I would have never thought it was possible. It was beautiful and peaceful. There was a current but nothing huge. I still wasn’t fast and I lagged behind at the end of the pack (or is it school?). I was passed by hundreds of people. But for me it was great. I never floated on my back. I just tried to be one with the water.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">T1: No screwing around. In and out faster than a drive thru customer at Chick-fil-A.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bike: Just brutal. The weather turned nasty real quick producing puddles as high as our pedals. The rain gave my mind a distraction and I had fun the first 80 miles, especially when I saw the family and caught up to Jenn. Then the headwind came and I could barely hold 16 mph. My IT band started giving me bad problems and it felt like someone stuck a knife in my right glute. I was miserable the last 30 miles and just wanted off the damn bike. I thought my legs would be crushed for the run and any possibility of a sub-13 hour was gone.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">T2: I limped in and got lost. I couldn’t find my bike in the parking garage. Total cluster. Finally found it and stormed out.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Run: I just worked the problem. I put my head down and embraced the suck. I decided on a 3 min run / 1 min walk routine. I stuck with it the entire marathon and it worked. Everyone walks the later miles so I decided to force myself to chill instead of blowing up. It worked. I hurt bad around mile 18 but Elizabeth gave me the pep talk I needed and Harlowe said “Daddy, don’t stop.” I just repeated that in my head the next eight miles.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I wanted a sub 13 and finished in 12:22. I’m beyond elated. My body is totally crushed but my spirit is on cloud nine. Time to drink on the beach!</span>

19396,"A List of Thank Yous","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A week ago right now I was sitting on Sam Eagle for six hours. Each time I biked past our support crew I thought of how thankful I am for all the people who support my crazy goals. Ironman is a multi-year journey and while I may have crossed the finish line alone, it took the work of a lot of people to get me there. Before Thanksgiving week is over allow me to throw out some thank yous:</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jenn Parvin - for taking on this challenge with me and for both pushing me and pulling me back when I needed it. George, the man who never stops smiling and bringing Positive Vibes, always there to help in every single way. Gardner Leigh and Whit for being amazing cheerleaders.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Endurance Farm - Chris and Jaime taught me how to swim, how to bike and how to use my body. Chris is a brother from another mother. No one has helped me more.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sarah Bishop - for having me in the best run shape of my life and for talking me off a ledge when I was sick and injured.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nancy Montgomery- for being an awesome massage therapist focused on athletes, who is constantly fixing my jacked up body.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kimmie and Donna Balaguer - Kimmie, my favorite liberal in the world, our cruise director, for being there for absolutely anything ever needed. Donna for being part of our family, chasing children and for being so damn fun.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Touchberry’s, the Arntz’s and Taylor Charpia- for trekking to Mexico to stand in the rain to cheer us on.  Jaime for being a rabbit for me to chase all year.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Push and Laurens Group - the entire team has been supportive but I have to specifically call out Phil Vangelakos for taking the reins of Push this year and Christiana Purves, Jordan Russell, Phil Bailey and Austin Stukins for tackling so many business trips, allowing me to stay off the road this year more than I have in fifteen years.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lastly, my family. This is too much for a couple sentences. Elizabeth, Harlowe, Tennyson and Lawton are everything. Everything.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are many more but I cannot go on forever. People like Cannoli who constantly send encouraging messages. You all know who you are. Thank You!</span>

We hear of the slaves routed through Charleston, the angry words of John C Calhoun and the bigotry of Ben Tillman.  We hear of how South Carolina tore the nation apart. Rarely do we hear how South Carolina helped create this nation.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We were a late supporter of the cause and it took a lot of convincing for South Carolina to sign the Declaration of Independence. As the richest city in the colonies, Charleston was full of British loyalists who had a lot to lose. It was also pretty obvious that Charleston would be a first and primary target for British invasion. Charleston, along with Savannah did fall and the British were poised to move on from the South to the North where they could focus all efforts on destroying Washington’s army.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Most of you outside of South Carolina have probably never heard of The Swamp Fox, Francis Marion. You may have seen The Patriot, starring Mel Gibson. The character was a composite of three men - Andrew Pickens, Thomas Sumter and mostly Francis Marion.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Marion is considered the father of guerrilla warfare. Rather than confronting superior British forces face to face, which was the norm, Marion raised a militia and moved in secret throughout the woods and swamps of South Carolina to cut off British supply lines. His efforts hindered British southern efforts, forcing Cornwallis to refocus time, resources and men down South. This splitting of British priorities allowed Washington to gain decisive wins up North while also giving time for the French to arrive.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There’s so much to the story of Francis Marion. I loved this book for many reasons. Marion’s character and leadership as well as military genius could take a lifetime of research in itself. This book provides a good broad overview. Mostly though I loved this book because as a South Carolinian I literally walk through or drive past so much history on a daily basis. So many battles happened right here where I stand yet I go about my day ignoring or forgetting. This book should be read by every lover of American history, but it’s damn near required reading for every South Carolinian.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hi, I’m the asshole.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A few years ago a local magazine did this feature on me in which they wrote “If you don’t want to know what Wesley Donehue thinks, you’d best not ask him. He’s smart, passionate, talented, and ferociously honest.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m not sure about being smart, but I am ferociously honest. Everyone will tell you that. It makes me a great consultant. It has also lost me clients, colleagues, friends and staff. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Honesty is a great trait. At least compared to the bullshit artists who dominate business and politics. The problem is that people with absolute candor can also come across as absolute assholes. That’s me. I’m the asshole. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">🙋🏻‍♂️</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Most people are candid because they give a damn. They give too many damns. Unfortunately they, or we, don’t always show it. That’s where this book comes in.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the comments of this post I’ve included an image. You will see two axes. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The vertical axis is what the author calls “the give a damn axis” pointing toward care personally.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The horizontal axis is “the willingness to piss people off” axis pointing toward challenge directly.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The key is to get in the quadrant where care personally meets challenge directly. This is where radical candor lies. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Truthfully, I live in this quadrant. Or, I should say, I think I live in this quadrant. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I care. I care too much. I care about my clients and I care deeply about my staff. The problem here is balance. I have a natural tendency to lean more into candidness than caring because I assume people know how much I care. That assumption gets me into trouble and I fall into the bottom right quadrant, what the author calls “obnoxious aggression” or “the asshole quadrant.” </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The best bosses challenge their employees while showing empathy. It’s not enough to feel compassion. You have to actually show compassion. That’s easier said that done. Luckily, the author gives a detailed roadmap on how to get there.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I enjoyed this book because I needed this book. In a lot of ways it was a slap in the face. Mostly I realized that it doesn’t matter what I think about myself. What matters is what others think about me. They won’t think of me as a wise consultant, good teammate or great boss if they think I’m an asshole. As I tell every political client, they have to like you before they will listen to you. Your ideas are shit if they think you’re an asshole.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As for me, while nailing the honesty part of this equation, I have to not only care, but show I care.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I recommend this book to all entrepreneurs.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In continuing my research into everything crypto I picked this one up because it’s number 1 on Amazon. Whether or not you should read this book is completely dependent upon your journey into the world of finance, economics and cryptocurrency.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pros:</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It explains the history of money and what money actually is. In fact, it actually focuses more on the history of money than on cryptocurrency and for that reason alone I think you should read it. Because let’s be honest. You think you know but you don’t because our education system is built to keep us all stupid.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It explains the basics of Bitcoin, why it’s digital currency and why it’s a good store of value.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It does a great job explaining why you should buy as much Bitcoin as you can.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cons:</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It author doesn’t believe in the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin. He doesn’t see the bigger picture at all. In fact he actively attacks anyone who believes in the concept of Web3 and says that blockchain will not be a revolutionary technology. He calls it “an overhyped toy.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">He diminishes the roll of Altcoins, including Ethereum. History has already proven him to be wrong. About Altcoins he writes “one has to wonder if their only purpose is to advance the richness of its creators.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Summary:</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At this point I’m consuming at least two hours of crypto information every day. Something I read two days ago is already old. So yeah, a book written in 2018 on this topic is going to be absolutely ancient. I’m torn on this recommendation. Yes, you should read it to understand money and Bitcoin. You should not read it to understand anything else. In fact, read it up to Chapter 10 and then toss it.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This will be a short review because my week is stacked with insanity before everyone checks out for Christmas week.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All Systems Red, the first in The Murderbot Diaries series, is a must-read novella for every science fiction fan. It’s a quick read full of wit and action. I can’t wait to start the second book this weekend. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Murderbot is a robot, one of many, created and leased out by a company that specializes in security and defense. Murderbot is a security bot and he’s not really a robot at all. He’s a cyborg, part machine and part cloned human, which means he has consciousness. Each cyborg has a governor which allows it to be controlled by humans, but this particular “SecUnit” has hacked its governor so that he can be autonomous. He then names himself Murderbot because its primary function is to murder. However, instead of murdering all the humans he just keeps doing what they tell him to do while spending its time watching “serials” which I think are the future’s soap operas. Then all hell breaks loose when something tries to kill the team he has been leased to and our boy Murderbot gets to work.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This book is short. The humor and action will make you keep turning pages so you’ll probably knock it out in a day. I definitely recommend this book to all my fellow nerds out there.</span>

19516,"Peloton's Week From Hell","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Move Fast Without Breaking Your Reputation</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">— Peloton’s Week From Hell</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Peloton is having the year from Hell and even when they do everything right and I’m ready to label them this week’s big winner on the Under Fire podcast, things immediately go sideways. They just cannot win.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Their stock price has continued to fall all year as American’s are fed up with quarantine and getting out of their homes for outdoor and gym workouts. Peloton bikes are collecting dust while sales tumbled and projected sales look abysmal. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Just when it looked like things couldn’t get worse, HBO’s rebooted Sex and the City killed off Mr Big in it’s first episode. He had a heart attack while riding a Peloton and watching a trainer loaned to the show by Peloton. HBO didn’t warn Peloton of Mr Big’s demise. And because Sex and the City and Peloton pretty much share the exact same target audience, Peloton’s stock price tumbled 25%.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Peloton went into action mode with a speed I typically only see in political campaigns. I was impressed. Real impressed. First they released a quick statement from a cardiologist blaming Big’s death on years of smoking, drinking and eating red meat. He also had heart problems two decades ago on the show. They went on to say that if not for the Peloton, Big probably would have been dead years ago.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even more impressive is that they released an ad, staring Mr Big and voiced by Ryan Reynolds stating that Mr Big was very much alive and ready for his next ride. The ad, produced by Reynolds, was up within 36 hours of Big’s death. This is almost unheard of in corporate and a lesson taken directly from political campaigns. The ad quickly went viral. Very impressive!</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But with speed comes danger and this one blew up in Peloton’s face. As soon as the ad went up two women came forward accusing Mr Big actor Chris Noth of sexual assault and the ad was scrubbed from existence. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Typically I would criticize Peloton for using Noth without extensive research into his past, but lets be real - the man has been used by HBO for over twenty years so it could be assumed that if nothing has yet to come out, nothing will come out. It makes you wonder why now, but that’s a topic for another day.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are two lessons from this story:</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First, a corporation must move with the speed of a political campaign. They need operatives (like us, and now it seems, like Ryan Reynolds) who can build out and launch quality content within hours. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Second, moving fast is key but not at the expense of research. If you move too fast you will trip over your own feet.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mark Zuckerberg says that you should “move fast and break things.” He’s right, unless that thing you’re breaking is your own reputation.</span>

Harvey</a>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Crypto is all the rage right now and so many of you are really interested. I know that because I’m getting blown up with a ton of questions from friends, staff and people following me that I really don’t even know. I too am super interested so I’m spending a lot of my down time reading books, articles and white papers, listening to podcasts, watching YouTube videos and taking courses. I hope I can pass along some of this knowledge to you.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">De-Fi, or Decentralized Finance, is an important aspect of crypto and I believe it will be the future of finance. It’s a distributed network, based on the blockchain and controlled by computer code with no central controlling entity. That’s opposed to the current iteration, centralized finance, which is controlled by powerful entities such as governments and banks.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A book review is too short to explain how this works so instead I’ll just recommend you pick up this very short book to fully understand. While the author does a great job I will warn you that he gets very in-depth. Yes, it’s good for beginners, but it’s not one you can just listen to on a run. You need to read this one slowly. If you’re like me you will have to jump back and forth between the book and Google to understand broader financial concepts the author assumes you already know.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Outside of this book, I have one concern about this whole idea. These techies assume this will all happen because of the natural advancement of technology. What they fail to realize is that those with power never want to give up power and that wide adoption of decentralized finance will take much longer than they believe because government regulation will happen. You already see Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen constantly yellen. The crypto community fails to understand politics. They better start playing the game.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Still, I recommend this book to everyone wanting to understand crypto and the future of finance.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ravikant is a brilliant entrepreneur I’ve been following since hearing him on The Joe Rogan Experience. His outlook on life is one I have been trying to adopt.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Risk Is What Makes Entrepreneurs Different</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A Review of Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk, and The Bet of The Century by Tim Higgins</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m the dog who caught the car. I could step out of Push Digital today and no one would barely notice. Perhaps we wouldn’t be diversifying, planning for the future or starting new divisions, but we definitely would still be picking up huge political campaigns, servicing clients better than anyone else and winning huge races that impact the direction of our nation. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’ve built a machine that can run without me. It took thirteen years. I didn’t sell my company to a larger one like some of my competitors. Ownership hasn’t changed hands. I didn’t take a big investment. I just took risks. A lot of risks.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I had nothing when I went out on my own. Elizabeth supported our family through her job. I had one $500 a month client. When I got up to $2,000 per month in income I hired our first full-time staffer, gave him $1500 and lived off my $500. I did that for months. When I got to $2000 again I got another staffer. Then another. Numerous times I went without a paycheck for months so that I could make payroll or pay rent. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’ve put it all on line more times than I can remember at this point. I do remember a few things. I remember not sleeping for three nights after losing a major corporate client. I remember crying at my desk when I was stiffed $300,000 by a political client. I remember an invoicing error from Google that set us back $250,000. Each time I thought we were done. Each time I threw all my chips on the table.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Risk is what entrepreneurship is really all about. It’s hard to see. Money is easy to see. Someone is always counting your money. It’s why God told us not to covet. It’s natural. People see the new car, the new suit and the new office. They don’t see the times you could have lost it all. They don’t see when you got up from your sleepless haze and said “screw it. Lets do this.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m not Elon Musk. He is a once in a generation mind. We do have one thing in common, that one thing most entrepreneurs have in common. We risked it all. That’s my biggest takeaway from this book. It’s also why I’m so frustrated by the attacks on him from people like Elizabeth Warren. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Elon wasn’t given shit. He’s the richest man in the world because he made it happen. Because he took huge risks. Power Play tells the entire story of Tesla’s founding and growth, but what really stuck out to me was how Elon almost lost it numerous times. He had to sleep on couches and on factory floors. He funded the operation with his own money and when that was gone he was living on loans from friends. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now people are attacking him like he was handed everything, like he owes the world something beyond trying to save us from ourselves. It frustrates me because people want what Elon has without taking the risks. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s all about the risks. Success is all about the risks. Risk nothing, gain nothing. Risk everything and maybe, just maybe, you can have something. Maybe not everything, but definitely something worth risking it all for.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I enjoyed this book and recommend it.</span>

19569,"The Volatility of Cryptocurrency","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This past Fall I was up $180,000 in crypto.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Two weeks ago I was down $67,400.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yesterday I was down $34,600.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This morning when I woke up I was up $3. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Right now I'm up $5,354.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Crypto is the hot new thing and I'm getting far more questions about it than anything else. Before you get involved please know that it's incredibly volatile. If you are trying to day trade and make a quick buck you are most likely going to lose it all.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rule #1 - Don't invest anything you aren't willing to lose.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rule #2 - Play long term.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rule #3 - Don't check it every day. You will stress yourself out and live on an emotional rollercoaster. </span>

19572,"The Big 4 Have Overplayed Their Hands","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We are all caught in the rat race.  We rush from one thing to another, work to school to baseball practice, so rapidly that we barely have enough time to put the cereal bowl in the dishwasher. We surely don’t have time to research physiology or government regulations. That’s why we elect leaders, fund scientists and pay insurance companies. We go to work, pay taxes and expect our money to speak for us. We don’t pay attention because we pay others to do so for us.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We trust institutions like the media because we’ve been told it’s the fourth estate, the next branch of government. Journalists have always been there for us, keeping tabs on government and business, shining a light on corruption because, it is true, sunlight is the best disinfectant. They are here for us. They aren’t chasing profits. Or so we are told.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We trust because we have to. We trust because it’s more important to compete against our neighbors than it is to read a book. Fauci says it, Trump says it, Biden says, Tucker says it, Maddow says it, hell even Big Bird says it… so it has to be true. We follow like sheep because we have time for nothing else.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’ve been feeling pretty hopeless the last two years. I’ve felt like our nation was heading down a course that could not be reversed. I’ve felt like I was alone and that the supermajority of Americans were asleep, or worse, following Big Tech, Big Government, Big Media and Big Pharma like sheep.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is the first week I’ve felt any semblance of hope. Finally I feel a shift, albeit a slow one, in public sentiment. I finally feel like Americans are waking up.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The people are tired of lies and back peddling from politicians.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The people are tired of being told they need another shot, then another shot, then another shot and then another.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The people are tired of being put out of work while pharmaceutical companies print billions of dollars.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The people are tired of government actions creating inflation and putting us on a course toward global economic collapse.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The people are tired of censorship and the squashing of alternative scientific opinions.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The people are waking up. The Big 4 have overplayed their hands.</span>

19575,"America Must Reverse Course To Keep Thought Alive","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What did we accomplish this year?</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Covid still plagues the world. Nations remain shut down. The rich and the poor are further apart. We as a people are more divided than ever. Our leaders don’t lead. Our workers don’t work. The very foundations of our nations are crumbling while we stare at our phones and allow algorithms and media executives to control our feelings, and even worse, our thoughts.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Perhaps change is finally beyond our reach when even doing one’s own research is mocked. Maybe the problems are just too much to bare for a citizenry too oblivious to face them. Everything is fine. Someone else will handle it. Or maybe we’ve fallen too far down the clickhole to even care anymore.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some still care. Maybe even the majority still care. They care so much they think of nothing else. Or rather, feel nothing else. Fueled by echo chambers and cable news pundits, they point their energies toward the enemy, blaming them for every problem, refusing to budge and attacking anyone and everyone even hinting of compromise. They too see the nation crumbling but refuse to acknowledge they are holding the sledge hammer, day in and day out pounding down on the brittle ground keeping us connected.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There is a a narrow opportunity, a single escape we must run toward. We must turn inward and put up walls protecting our minds from manipulation. We must put down the phones and turn off the TVs. We must see truth as truth, fact as fact and people as people. We must cut the leash and refuse to be anything other than freethinking humans.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2022 is an important year. The course we are heading can be changed, but the divergent path is rapidly approaching. There does come a tipping point when manipulation wins and going backward becomes impossible. 2021 delivered a devastating blow to free thought but it’s not dead yet. Whether it survives 2022 is up to us.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“There is no one inventor of the scientific method. Like science itself, it continued to be refined thanks to the likes of Galileo, Bacon, Descartes, and Newton. The process involves 1. observation, including rigorous skepticism (to counter our cognitive biases); 2. formulating a hypothesis; 3. making a prediction that can be determined to be true or false; 4. experiments and testing to determine the validity of hypothesis. The process continually repeats, allowing better and better hypotheses to be tested and confirmed. Perhaps the most compelling thing about science and the scientific method is that it is almost never “good enough.” It is designed to continually bring in more evidence to prove existing understanding wrong and to correct it further.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Error correction is the basis of all intelligence.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">- Jeff Booth</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This week Big Tech companies such as Twitter and YouTube continued silencing scientists such as Dr Robert Malone and Dr Peter McCullough for their opposing opinions to current Covid treatments and regulations. Just yesterday Twitter and YouTube deleted Joe Rogan’s interview with Dr Malone giving no reason other than “it is misinformation.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I am no scientist or doctor, as many like to point out, so I don’t know if Malone or McCullough are actually wrong. I also don’t know if the scientists and doctors with Big Pharma companies are wrong. That’s the point. And that’s the reason for the scientific method.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I cannot say it any better than Booth writes in this book. “Error correction is the basis of all intelligence.” Therefore if we silence those who point out errors, we actually lose intelligence itself. We are no longer an intelligent species. We as humans become something different.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I fear that free-thought is on life support, the scientific method has been discarded and Americans have become too dumbed down by social media scrolling to even care. However, as I wrote earlier this week, I do finally see signs of Americans waking up. Much of it is fueled by Joe Rogan who we saw this week now has double the audience of traditional Big Media outlets.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Actually, that’s not what this book is about at all. It’s just that Booth’s description of the scientific method punched me right in the face at the exact moment this was all on my mind. This book is actually about how scientific advancements in technologies such as artificial intelligence, energy, self-driving cars and manufacturing will create high unemployment, over abundance and deflation. He argues that we will have much more at lower costs and we must embrace that so those unemployed can also reap the benefits of technological advancement without transfers of wealth.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Booth writes “We are trapped in a system where we don’t know what we would do with ourselves if we didn’t have jobs. Allowing abundance without the jobs might actually open an entirely new enlightenment era where we have time to enjoy the benefits that technology brings.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I argue all this technological advancement can only happen if we allow the scientific method to thrive, meaning we must stop censoring scientific dissent.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I really enjoyed this entire book and recommend it to anyone interested in economics or emerging technologies.</span>

19585,"Why This Is The Greatest Time For Opportunity","Welcome to 2022!

So much opportunity lies ahead of us because the media has everyone full of fear. The new Covid variant will kill you if you leave your house. Hyperinflation is on the way so brace for global economic collapse.

Fear creates stagnation. Here's the good news: <strong>stagnation for everyone else creates opportunity for you.</strong>

The world is changing as rapidly as it did during the beginning of the industrial revolution. This new knowledge revolution is actually reversing the industrial revolution where everything became centralized. Today everything from financial services to space travel is being decentralized.

Blockchain technology is disrupting banking and even government controlled finance.

Fueled by the pandemic, virtual and augmented reality is coming quicker than anyone originally thought. It will disrupt the office, travel, real estate development and life as we know it.

Artificial intelligence may never truly replace the creative brain, but it will replace factory lines, distribution workers and even delivery drivers.

Space travel is no longer being led by government initiatives. Instead, it's being challenged by private companies.

Energy is becoming cheaper to harness as the cost of solar technologies trend downward like flat screen televisions and we see more electric vehicles at every stoplight.

The media landscape has been changing for a decade and we now enter a new phase where a single person with a microphone can double the audience of a global media titan.

Any one of these disruptions will change our world, but when combined they will change humanity itself.

As the world changes and central power from historical authority is decentralized this generation has more opportunity than any generation before. You can invest in cryptocurrency. You can create a business capitalizing on one of these emerging technologies. Or you can simply grab a microphone. The possibilities are endless.

The aliens could arrive or maybe our future selves shut down the simulation before any of this happens (I’m kidding, sorta). Until then I recommend picking up <a href=""https://wesleydonehue.com/we-must-allow-the-scientific-method-to-thrive/"">The Price of Tomorrow - Why Deflation Is The Key To An Abundant Future, by Jeff Booth</a>. Booth does an excellent job explaining many of these changing factors. I’ve posted a full book review here.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Internet has given you an opportunity you may not realize you have. A single opportunity that brings hundreds of subsequent opportunities. You have the ability to find killers who are willing to be your mentor and entrepreneurs doing things much bigger than you who are willing to give you their advice.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our new office is simply spectacular. The delays created a lot of frustration but the wait was worth it. The wait also forced me to face one of my biggest weaknesses.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is important to do a self analysis, specifically a SWOT analysis, throughout the year. I do one each quarter.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">SWOT stands for:</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Strengths</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Weaknesses</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Opportunities</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Threats</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is how we approach each client and each situation. It is also how I approach my own self improvement. I attempt to firm up my strengths, strengthen my weaknesses, deflect potential threats and rapidly take advantage of opportunities.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">My biggest weakness is impatience. Like Veruca Salt “I want it now.”  Building out the new Push office as well as the new Frothy Beard location in 2021 while also dealing with every COVID delay possible may have finally fixed this weakness. Now about 763 other weaknesses to tackle.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Perhaps this is something you can try in your life. Draw a quadrant diagram and label the quadrants S, W, O, T. Then just start listing. It’s that simple.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re in downtown Charleston I would love for you to stop in and see the new place. We are at 343 East Bay St. Just give me a heads up first.</span>

19602,"Put In The Work and Do What Others Won’t","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I have a lot of notches in my win column, but one race always stands out - Shane Massey for South Carolina State Senate. It wasn’t the biggest and it wasn’t the sexiest. It was, however, the one that allowed me to level up from political operative to political consultant.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It was 2007, and the Democrat who held the seat resigned to take a big paying Washington job. There weren’t many people who thought Republicans could pick up the seat with a 41% BVAP (Black Voting Age Population). It wasn’t a safe Democrat seat but it was so difficult that most Republicans wrote it off. Even the folks I worked for at the time wrote it off. They actually refused to let me work for Shane because they didn’t want the L. Eventually, they conceded after I threatened to do the race in my spare time. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I wanted the race so badly because I knew Shane was different. He was only 32, just five years older than me, and I could sense a work ethic in him that I hadn’t seen in other candidates. I told him exactly what he needed to do to win, and he didn’t hesitate to trust me. He explained his high values and told me that he would follow my lead as long as I didn’t ask him to do anything shady. He did precisely that.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shane Massey surprised everyone for two reasons:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">He outworked everyone.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In both the special primary and general elections, and then again immediately in the normal elections, Shane worked harder than anyone he was up against. He knocked on every door and made every call sent to him. Eventually, I told Shane to not even leave his house. I said, “I don’t care if you even get out of your pajamas or take a shower. Just call everyone on this list.” It was thousands of people. He just sat there for hours at a time and called all day, day after day.  No excuses. No refusals. He just did the work.</span>
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> He did what others wouldn’t.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Republicans in the South typically write off African American voters. The demographic is reliably Democratic, so using limited money and time is generally targeted to those swing voters a candidate can actually persuade. Shane didn’t agree, and neither did I. Shane did something you rarely see Republicans do. He knocked on the doors of African Americans. He called African Americans. He went to NAACP meetings. He visited black churches. I don’t remember exactly what the number was, but to win by the margins we got on Election Day, Shane would have needed about 14% of black voters. That just doesn’t happen.  But it does if you’re as nice a person as Shane Massey.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’ll take some credit for this win. I developed the strategy and told Shane what he should do. But this win was because of grit. To this day, I’ve never advised a person who worked as hard as Shane Massey. I’m proud that he’s my friend and now the Majority Leader of the South Carolina Senate.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">These lessons aren’t just limited to political campaigns. You have an opportunity to win if you are willing to put in the world and do what others won’t. </span>

19605,"Winners Don’t Get Sidetracked By Shiny Objects","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS flooded South Carolina when national Democrats wrongly thought they could take out United States Senator Lindsey Graham. Our team had the financial resources to run the perfect digital campaign we’ve always dreamed of for the first time ever. So you would think that was my favorite campaign of 2020. Nope!</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">My favorite campaign was the re-election of SC State Senator Chip Campsen. However, a lot of it was because of that big US Senate race. The cluttered airwaves forced me to get creative in developing a strategy that would grab the voters’ attention.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nationally we are considered one of the best GOP digital agencies. In South Carolina, I still do a lot of general consulting, meaning I oversee the entire campaign. Last cycle, I had the privilege of serving as SC Senator Chip Campsen’s GC while Push Digital oversaw all media. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Senator Campsen has represented South Carolina’s 43rd district since 2004, but he had an incredibly low name ID for two primary reasons. First, the district has grown by leaps and bounds with an incredible population boom, resulting in thousands of new voters. Second, Senator Campsen has not had opposition since the district was redrawn ten years ago. The district is long and skinny, encompassing a full half of South Carolina’s coast, making it difficult to campaign in, especially during COVID-19 lockdowns. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The district has been trending blue (or at least purple), as seen with the election of Democratic Congressman Joe Cunningham in 2018. Polls showed President Trump upside down in the district.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The biggest problem was the national attention on our state. Not only did the two US Senate races clutter the airwaves, but they were joined by every big SuperPAC and DC Committee. On top of that, the district was also covered up by a top targeted congressional race. In all my career, I had never seen everything so cluttered. Televisions, every digital platform, local newspapers… I mean everything! </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How do you get a message out when you can barely even buy an ad? How do you cut through the clutter?</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You do it by getting hyper-local. You use data to deliver niche messages to smaller audiences.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Through polling we discovered that both national and state issues moved voters, but what cut through the clutter were hyper-focused issues important to each local community in the highly spread-out district. Yes, we used broadcast and cable television to deliver a big picture message across the Charleston and Savannah DMAs. Still, half the resources were used to target local communities. We talked to Isle of Palms about tree cutting and parking meters. Edisto Beach cared about beach erosion. Kiawah Island cared about bobcats. Yes, bobcats. Poison was used to kill rats, bobcats ate the rats, and a local treasure was dying off. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Luckily I had a client in Senator Campsen who worked incredibly hard on local issues instead of getting sucked into the camera chasing gimmicks of national issues. Senator Campsen didn’t get sidetracked by shiny objects. He always focused on what moves the ball furthest down the field for his constituents.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Everyone thought this would be a close race. The State Democrats thought this was a pickup, and they poured a ton of money into it. In the end, we won by 14 points. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are some lessons here for you:</span>
<ol>
 	<li><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> There is a lot of opportunity in targeting smaller audiences using data and niche creative. You don’t have to target everyone to win. Find the people who matter with the message that cuts through the clutter. This is true across all marketing verticals.</span></li>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cool story, but someone always wins. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Winning is about consistency. It’s not about winning one campaign. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Michael Jordan wasn’t just a winner. He left a lasting legacy by turning other people into winners.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So how do you do that? </span>

19614,"America Is In Real Trouble, And You Need To Understand Why","<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/The-Fourth-Turning-audiobook/dp/B00005UPTV/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2KW88U7WB8DY0&amp;keywords=The+Fourth+Turning%3A+What+The+Cycles+of+History+Tell+Us+About+America’s+Next+Rendezvous+with+Destiny&amp;qid=1642183563&amp;sprefix=the+fourth+turning+what+the+cycles+of+history+tell+us+about+america+s+next+rendezvous+with+destiny%2Caps%2C55&amp;sr=8-1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><b>The Fourth Turning: What The Cycles of History Tell Us About America’s Next Rendezvous with Destiny</b></a>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I am not scared.  However, I am sad.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I am not scared because I see what’s happening. My head is not in the sand, and I see and prepare.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But I am sad to see where this nation is heading. We’ve lost our morals, which has made us lose our strength. The divisiveness is unraveling the fabric of our nation, and weak leadership throws fuel on the flame rather than shoring up our foundations. Simultaneously, competing countries like China, with immoral human rights violations, continue to grow in population, power ,and authority.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We go through our days as if America can never fall. As if somehow we are being protected by a magical power that “comes through the night with the light from above.” Its fantasy. The strength of our forefathers rallying against England or our grandfathers storming the beaches of Normandy does not mean we are strong forever. God has not promised America’s protection. We are not the promised land. And even if we were, He has proven he will let it and its people go through absolute hell.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The muscle of most bodybuilders eventually turns to flab. And sadly, that’s where we find America today. Strength has succumbed to complacency, creating a lazy, sluggish, emotional, and weak nation ill-prepared for threats.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">History has proven that America goes through a cycle about the length of an average human life or 80 years. Those years are broken into four “turnings” of about 20 years:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The High - “an upbeat era of strengthening institutions and weakening individualism, when new civic order implants and the old values regime decays.”</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Awakening - “a passionate era of spiritual upheaval, when the civic order comes under attack from a new values regime.”</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Unraveling - “a downcast era of strengthening individualism and weakening institutions, when the old civic order decays and the new values regime implants.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;"" aria-level=""1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Crisis - “a decisive era of secular upheaval, when the values regime propels the replacement of old civic order with a new one.”</span></li>
</ol>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When we forget the lessons taught to us by the crisis of the previous generation, we begin unraveling until the point of crisis. Then the cycle starts to repeat itself, if and only if we actually make it out of the Crisis, which is no certainty. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The previous cycle ended with WWII. Today we find ourselves in the fourth turning, The Crisis. Our nation hangs in the balance, and we have yet to decide whether or not our nation will repeat the cycle. Past nations have crumbled completely during The Fourth Turning, and there is no certainty that America will not do so.  Strauss and Howe wrote The Fourth Turning in 1997. Today their words seem prophetic:</span>

<i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“History is seasonal, and winter is coming. … The next Fourth Turning is due to begin shortly after the new millennium, midway through the 00 decade. Around the year 2005, a sudden spark will catalyze a Crisis mood. Remnants of the old social order will disintegrate. Political and economic trust will implode. Real hardship will beset the land, with severe distress that could involve questions of class, race, nation, and empire. . .The very survival of the nation will feel at stake. Sometime before the year 2025, America will pass through a great gate in history, commensurate with the American Revolution, Civil War, and twin emergencies of the Great Depression and World War II.</span></i>

<i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The risk of catastrophe will be very high. The nation could erupt into insurrection or civil violence, crack up geographically, or succumb to authoritarian rule.”</span></i>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is a book you must read immediately. I read it two years ago and picked it up again this year to remind myself that we are currently in some real trouble. How much risk is yet to be determined. Still as someone in politics with their ear to the ground at all times, I see every day getting worse, and I feel it will get a whole lot worse before it gets any better. That means you have two choices. You can ignore the storm, or you can prepare. To prepare, you must understand what’s happening. To truly understand what’s happening, you should pick up this book now.  It could be the most important book you have ever read.</span>

19622,"These Are The Traits of Unstoppable Winners","<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Relentless-Good-Great-Unstoppable/dp/B08KFGLH15/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Relentless%3A+From+Good+To+Great+To+Unstoppable+by+Tim+Grover&amp;qid=1642520023&amp;sr=8-1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Relentless: From Good To Great To Unstoppable by Tim Grover</a>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I went from being hesitant to being assured after reading Relentless by Tim Grover. This is an immediate must read for all high performers. The performance coach for Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Dwayde Wade doesn’t lay out a plan for being relentless. Instead he tells us why the greats are. You are either relentless or you’re not.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A few of my favorite points:</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You keep pushing yourself harder when everyone else has had enough.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You get into the Zone, you shut out everything else, and control the uncontrollable.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You have a dark side that refuses to be taught to be good.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You’re not intimidated by pressure, you thrive on it.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When everyone is hitting the “In Case of Emergency’ button, they’re all looking for you.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You don’t have to love the work, but you’re addicted to the results.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You trust very few people, and those you trust better never let you down.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not all of the points discussed by Grover are good. Being relentless comes at a cost. And at some point that cost must be paid.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In reading this book I felt like I was reading a description of myself. That may sound cocky, but another point is “you know exactly who you are.”  I know who I am. I am a man who is relentless in helping people win.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you see these qualities in yourself I suggest picking up this book today. If you are married to or have to work with one of these people, you need to read this book. The bookshelves are full of self help and motivational books. That’s not what this is. This is the definitive explanation of high performers.</span>

19626,"Focus On The Audience That Moves Numbers","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Winners don’t focus on everything. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Winners understand that when they focus on everything they focus on nothing. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Winners understand what really matters, what really drives results. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It was pretty obvious since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic that the disease targeted our elders and those with underlying health conditions. By focusing on those universes alone we could dramatically cut the death rate and stem the crisis.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Instead most governments focused on everyone. They shut down businesses and schools. They crushed our economies and put children years behind in their education. It’s becoming obvious that it was the wrong path, especially as COVID rates currently sit at a pandemic high. By focusing on everyone, governments did not decrease death rates while causing additional irreparable harm. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With one of the top five populations for elderly citizens and a top retirement state, Governor Ron Desantis didn’t really have a choice in focusing on everyone. He had to focus on seniors and in doing so, he understood that he could dramatically cut the death rate while keep societal norms in place. People kept their jobs and schools remained open. It was the right move. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Florida death rate remains mid-pack, but when you consider that Florida has one of the median oldest populations and COVID targets seniors, you see that Desantis made the right move.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That’s what winners do. In a crisis, they focus on the numbers. They measure. They see where the problem lies and they put their efforts on moveable universes. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As it relates to public relations or political campaigns, we focus on the universes we can move. As it relates to the pandemic, we should focus on the universes we can save.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That’s just one lesson from Episode 34. <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TNK0Ngot5LjwvThQZLGZ6?go=1&amp;sp_cid=7ef0795ab46080198055dd9f2babff07&amp;utm_source=embed_player_p&amp;utm_medium=desktop&amp;nd=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Click here</a> to listen to the full episode.</span>

19633,"Queen Elizabeth was right to cut Prince Andrew","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In politics and business there are very few traits more important than loyalty. You should stand with your teammates as long as possible. Slip ups happen and in today’s world of cancel culture our fear leads us to throw a teammate overboard too quickly. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sometimes, however, it’s not just a slip up. It’s a fatal error. At that point you have no option other than to amputate the rotten limb.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That is the place Queen Elizabeth has found herself in as her son, Prince Andrew, is being swept away in the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein saga.  A woman has accused Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell of pimping her out when she was just 17-years-old to Prince Andrew. Now that Maxwell has been found guilty and faces sentencing, it’s only a matter of time before she rolls over on Prince Andrew and others.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unfortunately for the Queen, this situation hits closer to home than a political or business teammate. It literally hits home. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In most cases it’s understandable for a person to stand beside a family member, even when they are wrong. Most people would understand because most people would link arms with their son, daughter, or brother, even if it means going down with the ship with them. That’s the situation we saw with the Cuomo brothers. I stand by my comments that while most people thought Chris Cuomo’s actions were wrong, they too would do anything they could to help their brother if they were in the same situation. It’s just what humans do.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Queen Elizabeth is in a different situation. She’s not just a mother. She’s the Queen of England. She is the representation of, not just one nation, but of a kingdom. To go down with her son would be to throw all residents of the United Kingdom on the sinking ship too.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In response, Queen Elizabeth has stripped Prince Andrew of all his royal and military titles. She has effectively kicked him out of the family. She stood by him as long as she could, but in the end, she could not take down the kingdom. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This story is far from over. Every member of the royal family, including the Queen, and their staff can be subpoenaed to find out what they knew of Andrew’s actions. This can turn into a huge PR nightmare. But for now, Queen Elizabeth has made the right move by tossing her son overboard.</span>

19638,"The Collapse of America Is Coming","<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m worried.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not just worried. I’m scared.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There’s a good chance that America is on the verge of collapse.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If not on the verge, at least on the path with no clear indication of reversal.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our financial system lies on a foundation as firm as jello.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We don’t make anything. We can’t find workers. Our monetary system is all smoke and mirrors. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our children are going to college for meaningless degrees while racking up debt they may never pay off. Instead of finding jobs and buying homes, they move back in with their parents. Inflation drives up the cost of goods, the cost of living and the cost of dreams. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All the while America prints money, funds people to play online and sells a dream that no longer exists. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Companies cannot find employees to do real work because real work is being redefined as having 500,000 Instagram followers. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The age of the average of the American blue collar worker continues to climb while China grows in strength and in power. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Make no mistake, America is in a state of decline. We’re softer. We’re more entitled. We’re lost. We have no political leadership selfless enough to fix the problem. Our President is in an obvious state of mental decline lacking the faculties to help even if he wanted to.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is why I’m so determined to take care of my own house. It’s why I’m learning everything I can. I know what we’ve been taught is not meant to help us be self-sufficient. It’s taught to us to make us fall in line. That’s the entire purpose of our public education system. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m warning you right now. You better get your house in order. You better stop following politicians and expecting government to make everything okay. Covid has proven that government is completely incapable of solving a crisis.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That means it’s on you. It’s on you to improve your health. It’s on you to build your wealth. It’s on you to secure your legacy.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If we have any single job it’s to secure the future for our children. I’ll be blunt - if you aren’t actively trying to leave this world better for your children then you are a shit parent and grandparent. It’s your job! Do it!</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I don’t know everything but I’m learning as much as I can. I’m here to pass on what I can about health, wealth and legacy. Let’s run together toward a better future before it’s too late, before there is no America left to leave.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m building a Facebook group. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I launched it a few months ago but I lacked my clear mission. After a couple months of really meditating on what I want to do with this group, I've finally figured it out. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I'm going to build a group of thousands of people focused on HEALTH, WEALTH AND LEGACY. That's how we fix America. My company, Push Digital, is trying to fix America at the macro level. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We are going to form a group trying to fix it at the micro level... family by family, home by home. We are going to teach each other how to focus on HEALTH, WEALTH and LEGACY.</span>

I remember going to a music fair at school and going home excited to tell Mom. It broke my heart when she told me that we could not afford an instrument or lessons. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That’s when I joined chorus and started singing. I sang growing up. I even sang in a number of weddings. Yep, your boy Wesley was a wedding singer.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s exciting to see Harlowe fulfill dreams I had for myself. That’s what this whole journey is about… giving the boys opportunities to win. I can’t win for them, but I can put them on a path toward winning in life.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Harry Potter, Moana, Frodo Baggins, Katniss Everdeen, Hercules, Steve Rogers.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They all left home after receiving a call to adventure. They passed a threshold into the unknown where they met a mentor. They journeyed into the belly of the beast where they were transformed. They returned home a hero. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All these stories follow the same formula laid out by Joseph Campbell in his lifetime’s work studying the myths of cultures since the beginning of time. He calls this formula “The Hero’s Journey.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Even the life of Jesus Christ follows the hero’s journey. While I believe He is the one true myth, there’s no denying his life follows the same arch and lays a foundation upon which many modern stories are built. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Take the story of Luke Skywalker for instance. Not only does he follow the hero’s arch but for him it goes a step further. George Lucas perfected the Star Wars story after reading Campbell’s “The Hero With a Thousand Faces.” Lucas openly says that Luke’s adventure follows every step of the hero’s journey, one much more detailed than I laid out above. One only needs to rewatch A New Hope to see every step. The cycle then repeats itself in Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi only to be repeated again by Rey in The Force Awakens. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I enjoyed this book a lot and since completing it three weeks ago I’m having a hard time watching or reading any fictional story without seeing it through the eyes of Joseph Campbell. His analysis of historical storytelling has influenced every current story told. It’s all the same journey. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I cannot say I recommend this book to everyone because many of you won’t find it fascinating. I certainly recommend it to all writers, lovers of fiction and especially, Star Wars fans. Just Google “George Lucas and Joseph Campbell” and you will understand why. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lastly, this book is a transcript of Campbell’s interview with Bill Moyers a couple years before his death. You can find the whole interview on YouTube and Audible. It’s a really good listen.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">— I’m four book reviews behind right now. I will try to get those up this week. In the meantime you can check out my website for a bunch of them. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I was puking in the Cancun airport and my friend, Jason, had to drag me onto the airplane. I didn’t want to go to a Mexican hospital.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I woke up in an American hospital with a 104 fever. I thought the plane had crashed and my wife and friends were dead.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I got on an airplane with my people. I woke up in a hospital alone. That’s all I knew.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All because of a pork taco. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Just days before, we were heading for this wonderful vacation in Talum. I had recently picked up The Four Hour Workweek by Tim Ferris and I couldn’t put it down. It was completely captivating and it reshaped the way I thought a business could run. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At that point I was running someone else’s business. I knew they would never go for these new ideas and it was at that moment, reading this book and captured in this picture that I decided to go out on my own.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It took another year. I couldn’t leave in the middle of an election cycle. Only assholes do that. But eventually I took one of the best actions of my life and made the jump. I bet on myself.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If there’s one lesson I wish I could implant into your brain it is to bet on yourself. Invest in yourself. Do that before you invest in the market, crypto or anything else.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This has been a long journey full of ups and downs. Twelve years later and I’ve learned a lot of lessons. There are so many things I’ve done right but so many more I’ve done wrong.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I want to share those lessons with you. Click the link in the comments and sign up for my newsletter. I’ve taken a couple weeks off for travel but I’ll be getting back on it next Wednesday. Maybe I’ll call it Wednesdays with Wesley.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I pulled an upper back muscle while doing bent over dumbbell lateral raises. The pain is resonating across my back and around to the front of my chest through my rib cage.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It hurts to sit, stand and lie down.  I am having a hard time focusing or getting any real work done. Training is impossible. I’m miserable.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I can understand, especially today, why both my parents went to doctors for their severe back pain. Back pain is debilitating.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What I don’t understand is how addictive pills used to alleviate pain were approved by the federal government. I don’t understand how the medical community overwhelming declared them safe. I don’t understand how criticism was so soundly silenced.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Except I do understand. Because the same exact thing is happening right now.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let’s be clear. Opioids were deemed safe by the federal government. Government employees were bribed with jobs. Critics were ostracized.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now my parents are dead. Mom died directly of the pills. Dad moved onto harder stuff.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All for money.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So when I’m criticizing the pharmaceutical industry don’t come at me with some right wing conspiracy theory label. I’ve been saying these things for fifteen years. As one of my mentors once told me “you’re not paranoid if they really are out to get you.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That’s my plan. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Really, a plan. Not just a wish. I’m putting measures in place every day to give myself three to four extra decades. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s all about longevity. Yes, I want to perform. You know how much I love to race. And yes, I want to look good too. But in terms of importance, longevity sits at the top.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I want to change the direction of my family tree and leave a lasting legacy for future generations. The longer I’m on Earth the greater chances are that I reach my goal.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ok, this is where my Christian brothers and sisters start commenting about how we aren’t supposed to be here longer. Those comments hit my page last week. Ok, well first off, the Bible clearly states that many of it’s characters lived long lives. Second, the longer I’m here the longer I can teach my family. Third, we will be in Heaven forever. What’s wrong with being here a little longer?</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Anyway, sorry for the weird tangent there. This book is all about increasing our lifespans through a combination of life habits, the elimination of killers and new medical discoveries. Each of those will add extra years to our lives.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exposure to cold, dietary restrictions, eliminating sugar, supplementation and new drugs are just a few examples. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I recommend this book to anyone who loves body hacking as much as I do. The book also includes a couple great chapters about the hazards of increasing lifespans, most notably the impact of overpopulation on the planet. Just a warning, some of the book is very scientific and can be difficult to read. He gets way in the weeds.</span>

Want a million followers?

Look, it doesn’t matter who I talk to - US Senators, major corporations, small businesses, and even individuals trying to build their personal brand - everyone wants digital growth.

More followers.
More emails.
More customers.
More money.

I'll tell you like I tell all my clients, there is no overnight pathway to a million followers. But there is a formula that is pretty simple to grasp: Storytelling + Paid Advertising = GROWTH

That’s what we do here at Push Digital.

That’s also the premise for One Million Followers by Brendan Kane.

He explains the process of content ideation and creation, paid advertising, and testing. He focuses on the idea that I've been preaching for years - when it comes to digital advertising, you have to pay to play. Organic social is dead unless you can come up with that one-in-a-million viral idea. And that's assuming you're not going viral for all the wrong reasons.

That's why he says to focus on the math, or what we at Push call KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). Figure out how many dollars it takes to make ten dollars. Test your message, your format and your audience. Eventually you will figure out what works and then double down.

One Million Followers is a good book for beginners. If you don’t have a lot of experience with digital advertising, you can start here. If you’re a more experienced marketer I would skip over this one.",,2022-02-07,post,https://wesleydonehue.com/want-one-million-followers/,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/220204_WesleyDonehue_BookReviews_One-Million-Followers.png,"220204_WesleyDonehue_BookReviews_One Million Followers",,,,https://wesleydonehue.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/220204_WesleyDonehue_BookReviews_One-Million-Followers.png,,"Book Reviews",,publish,6,lianasarapas,liana@pushdigital.com,Liana,Sarapas,want-one-million-followers,,,0,0,0,open,open,2022-02-08

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Are you willing to pay the price of winning?</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you're like me, somewhere along the way you've struggled with the concept of work/life balance.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It's a term used so often that sometimes it's worth considering its meaning. When you hear work/life balance today what most people really mean is that they go to work and then go home and the two are separate like church and state, in both time and thinking. That’s just not how winners roll. Winners are obsessed with what they do. They’re never off work because they never stop thinking about work. They’re rarely truly present. And the implications of that mentality are what Tim Grover tries to tackle in this book.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A few years ago I was working for a candidate with a net worth of about $100 Million. He called me needing help with one of his staffers who said he needed more work/life balance.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Wesley, you know work/life balance is bullshit, right” he asserted. “If you want it bad enough you wake up thinking about it and you go to sleep thinking about it. Even when you’re sitting on the couch with your wife you’re thinking about it. You’re never off work.”</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I think about that every day because he was absolutely right. Winners don’t have a work/life balance. They have a work/life symbiosis.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yes, I know, science nerd. Symbiosis is in itself a form of balance. Two distinct organisms live together, and in a mutualist symbiosis, they depend on each other to live.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That’s work and life.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Look, I’m not saying that’s a good thing. Tim Grover isn’t saying so either. He writes that this mentality can have a damaging impact on a person because they aren’t very well rounded. It can devastate a family.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kobe Bryant, who Grover trained, figured it out. He was as obsessed with his family as he was with basketball. That’s what made him so remarkable. Somehow he was able to be a winner at both. When he died he was chasing his obsession of turning his daughter into the Kobe Bryant of women’s basketball.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now if we look at Elon Musk, not covered in this book, we see a man obsessed with his work, who doesn’t sleep and often lives from his factory. We also see a man who can’t seem to hold down a relationship. Elon is a winner, but at what cost?</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I loved this book because Tim Grover doesn’t bullshit around. He’s as honest here as he was in his first book, Relentless. He tells you how to become a winner, but he gives warnings along the way. Winning comes at a cost. You have to decide if you’re willing to pay it.</span>

19694,"Pay Attention To Where You’re Going","Have you ever gotten so busy working that you stop paying attention to the direction you're heading in?

There is a mentality on social media that the way to get where you want to go is through sheer hustle. You've got to grind! Go crush it! 10x it!

I've learned from experience that hustle isn't all it takes.

It was 2020, and I was in the middle of the Palmetto 200, a relay race from Columbia to Charleston, South Carolina. I was in the zone, grinding away the miles, when I heard a car horn and then saw a guy in a van flagging me down. It wasn’t a guy on my team. It was a guy another team, someone I knew from church. “Hey Wesley, you’re about two miles off course.” I had missed a marker and I ended up being two miles of course. That meant I had 4 extra miles to run to get back on course. I learned the hard way that hard work is only part of the equation. You can run all day but be running in the wrong direction.

If you want to win, it's not just about hustle. It's about setting a goal, being mindful, and being disciplined enough to stay focused on your destination every step of the way. I've realized that I can't wait on others to teach me what I want to know. I can't skimp on the miles if I want to run the marathon. And I can't find lasting wealth by playing someone else's financial game. I have to set a goal and keep putting in the work to improve myself

Take it from me, if you're not willing to set your own course and commit to it, you're likely to fall for an influencer trying to sell you a shortcut. And that's a great way to waste all your hard work moving in the wrong direction.

Here is to staying on course!

19697,"Putting Your Priorities On Health, Wealth and Legacy","Maybe you're right. Maybe you don't have enough time.

That's something I hear from people that reach out to me looking to improve themselves over and over. ""I just don't have enough time."" So maybe you're right. Maybe you don't have time to work out, learn about nutrition, or start a side business. But, what about your kids? Or your spouse? Or your friends? Do you have time for them? Or do you make it?

See, my wife and kids, they're my priority. I DO have time for them. Always. And a long time ago I started to realize that if I can choose to make them a priority over the comfort of my living room couch or the glow of a screen, can't I make time for other things too.

That's a harsh dose of reality for some of you. That you're wasting all the time you say you don't have on stuff that doesn't matter. But, it's worth hearing when you start to realize what you're missing.

If being a father has taught me anything, it’s that time flies. You blink your eyes and your newborn is seven years old. I have no idea where that time goes, and it scares me. Today a friend sent me a picture from high school graduation taken 24 years ago. It feels like yesterday. And what really freaks me out is that 24 years from now I will be 66 years old. That means I need to maximize every hour I have.

And so do you. I get that life can't always be a hustle, and we all need our downtime. But life isn't downtime. Life is an accumulation of conscious moments. And either you work every day to get better about choosing those moments, or you sacrifice them. And once they're gone, you don't get them back.

You DO have enough time if you get your priorities straight. Mine are health, wealth, and legacy. I want to change the direction of my family tree for good. What are yours?

PS: I've started a Facebook group for people that are ready to stop wasting time and start seizing their moments.

19711,"6 Things Entrepreneurs Should Focus On","<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Get-Grip-Your-Business/dp/1936661837"">Traction: Get a Grip on Your Business</a>

Are you an entrepreneur who occasionally walks in the office and thinks “what the hell am I doing today?”

It’s typically not from a lack of work to do. It comes from having too much to do. It’s that feeling of being so overwhelmed that you can’t take the advice of eating the elephant one bite at a time because you don’t know if you should start eating the trunk or the foot first.

That’s where I found myself last week. My operating system was clogged and needed a reset. So I picked Traction back up to remind myself of the EOS - Entrepreneurs Operating System. The EOS really helped me a couple years ago but since then I’ve dropped it. Not on purpose. You know how it goes. You read a good idea. You try it. And even when it works it just gets dropped because, well, life I guess.

So here I am, trying the EOS again which states that an entrepreneur should focus solely on six things:
<ol>
 	<li>Vision - setting the path for the company.</li>
 	<li>Data - focusing on the real numbers.</li>
 	<li>Process - the mechanics of the company.</li>
 	<li>Traction - setting goals and keeping people focused on them.</li>
 	<li>Issues - solving problems as the come up.</li>
 	<li>People - the most important part of the business.</li>
</ol>
Specifically this time I was most attracted to the Entrepreneurs score card - a simple one pager updated every day to help me stay focused on the numbers. When I focus on the numbers I see if the processes are working, if the goals are being met and if problems are arising.

I like this book because it’s practical and provides real action items I can take immediately. I suggest it to all entrepreneurs.

19717,"Where Should You Be Investing...Content Development or Advertising?","I have buddy who owns a restaurant here in Charleston. He was spending $5000 each month on content development and only $1000 on advertising. I told him to flip those numbers and he will see huge social growth. It’s happening with a 500% increase in reach.

He thought more content was the key. He’s partly right. Storytelling through a lot of content is great, but it doesn’t matter if no one is seeing it.

Let me be clear - organic social is DEAD.

Okay, there are a few exceptions like TikTok. But for the most part you have to pay to play if you’re promoting a business, political campaign or personal brand.

If you have limited funds I would focus on less content with more promotion to a targeted audience. That’s how to get the biggest bang for your buck in terms of both money and time.

19730,"Want to live a longer and more fulfilling life? Start here.","<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Life-Force-Breakthroughs-Precision-Transform/dp/1508287740"">Life Force: How New Breakthroughs in Precision Medicine Can Transform the Quality of Your Life &amp; Those You Love</a>

I think we’re all in the market to live a longer more fulfilling life. But most of us don’t know where to start the journey. If COVID taught us anything though, it’s that focusing on our personal health is essential. If you’re like me and don’t rely on pharmaceutical companies and the government to manage your health, Tony Robbins’ newest book “Life Force” is an excellent jump start to your longevity journey.

Look, I haven’t always been athletic. I still consider myself a middle of the pack, wannabe endurance athlete. But I’ve come a long way. I was raised on microwavable meals and sugary soft drinks. I used to drink too much. I smoked through college and grad school. I have a small frame so I just never paid much attention to managing my weight. And when you’re young that seems to be the metric that most people pay attention to.

Things started to change first with my wife’s fitness journey. She’s the hardest working, most disciplined person I know. I was watching her dive into her fitness journey just as I was getting hit with some hard moments. We lost mom. Then dad. Then Robert. That all showed me the importance of focusing on health. Soon after I found myself in a doctors office hearing about my unusually high blood pressure.

Life was taking its toll on me.

I needed motivation and joined a workout group called F3. It totally changed my life. From endurance events and team work outs, to dialing in my diet and growth hacking (my new obsession), the steps I’ve taken are compounding and the results are addictive. My new goal: I’m going to live to 120 and be active all the way up until my death.

If you want to live a longer and more fulfilling life, this book is a great place to start. It’s a great place to begin your course correction. It’s also a great book to learn about new scientific breakthroughs in body hacking. Robbins does a good job combining lessons from many other books I have recommended to you such as Breathe, Sleep and Lifespan.

I do have one big complaint about this book. Robbins is the ultimate salesman and he’s really in your face about it in every chapter. I do not mind the occasional passive pitch, but he’s overt and annoying throughout this entire book. If you can look past all that, then I recommend you pick this up. Do what I did and course correct before it’s too late.

19732,"When is the last time you were truly present?","<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/New-Earth-Awakening-Purpose-Selection/dp/0452289963"">A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose</a>

“All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was... what he was doing.”

* Master Yoda

If you’re like me, and I believe you are, you’re never truly present. I recommend Eckhart Tolle’s “A New Earth” to help you fix the problem. And it is a problem.

I went out for a 12 mile run today. It took three hours. I stopped at the aquarium to watch the sun rise over the harbor. I sat on a bench at the battery. I stopped for a biscuit and coffee. I don’t have a race coming up so I decided to relax and enjoy the morning.

For the first time in a long time I decided to be present.

I love to cross finish lines. I love accomplishing a big goal that required months of work. It’s not the race. It’s the planning and executing.

I don’t love to run. I run because it gets me to that end goal. I don’t take the time to enjoy the strain on my body or the sun on my skin or the views. I don’t think to myself how lucky I am that I have some peace and quiet, alone, with no laptop or conference call. No kids screaming “help me.” And that’s sad.

I’m Luke Skywalker. I’m always in the future. I’m always looking to the next place I have to go or the meeting I have to get to. I’m thinking about the next business trip or Harlowe’s cello lesson. How is traffic going to be today? What’s my training plan tomorrow morning? What’s the Push A/R? How did Frothy Beard do last night?

I’m never just here. Like, right HERE right NOW. I know that and I know it’s not good.

I’m not different. I believe that’s most of us. We are just thinking about where we need to go next. Get the kids to school, get to work, take the kids to practice, get everyone fed. If not, then we are busy watching someone else live their life. We are glued to the vacationing couple on Instagram or the two women fighting on that reality show.

How many of us are really living in the moment and enjoying the Now? How many of us are wasting precious minutes thinking about how little time we have left?

Eckhart Tolle focuses on those questions in masterpiece “The Power of Now.” In his follow up, “A New Earth,” he refocuses here, but on a global level, explaining what’s happening to the world as a result of us not living in our limited moments.

He writes:

“A vital question to ask yourself is: What is my relationship with the present moment? Then become alert to find out the answer. Am I treating the Now as no more than a means to an end? Do I see it as an obstacle? Am I making it into an enemy? Since the present moment is all you ever have, sense Life is inseparable from the Now, what the question really means is: what is my relationship with Life?”

Those are important questions we must ask ourselves.

I love Tolle’s writings and I love this one. I’ve been putting in work in recent months to live in the now. I’m getting better, especially as it relates to the family, but I have a long way to go. I recommend you read this book.

19741,"The 50th Law","<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/50th-Law-Robert-Greene-Collection/dp/1846680794/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="">The 50th Law</a>

So why should you listen to advice from the rapper who hung upside down that the Super Bowl?

What I did not realize is that 50 Cent used the money from his best selling albums to become a successful entrepreneur. Unlike some rappers, he was wise with his money. He bought cash producing assets, like businesses, and made smart investments. He invested in Vitamin Water as a startup. When it was purchased by Coca-Cola, 50 walked away with $100 Million.

I identified with 50’s struggles growing up. And his desire to lift himself up out of poverty. I was shocked at how much this book resonated. Here’s a passage that had me thinking...

“We see the following occur over and over: a person has success when they are younger because they have deep ties with a social group. What they produce and say comes from a real place and connects with an audience. Then slowly they lose this connection. Success creates distance. They come to spend most of their time with other successful people. Consciously or unconsciously, they come to feel separated and above their audience. The intensity in their work is gone and with it any kind of real effect on the public.”

Here 50 Cent is talking about rappers. He goes on to the tell the story of Malcolm X and how he believed leaders in the Nation of Islam were losing touch with the struggles of black Americans.

The same can be said with our elected leaders, government bureaucrats and the political consulting class, in Washington. So much messaging from Washington seems to completely ignore the struggles of middle America. It’s exactly why Donald Trump’s message resonated so well on the right. Somehow a billionaire from NY was more in touch with the pulse of the Republican Party than any Washington politician or consultant. The Washington brand is broken.

I definitely recommend this book.

This is a short review of a short book. Its length is not a measurement of its importance. In fact, it’s so important that I read it twice each year, and starting now I’ll be reading it every month as a reminder of how I should act in all instances.

Here’s the summary:

Agreement 1: Be Impeccable With Your Word.

Agreement 2: Don't Take Anything Personally.

Agreement 3: Don't Make Assumptions.

Agreement 4: Always Do Your Best.

19766,"How To Build Wealth, Not Bank Accounts","Let me fix a misperception.

I own multiple digital businesses. I co-own a brewery. I own beach houses. I own a beautiful historic building in downtown Charleston.

None of that means I’m rich. In fact, I probably have less cash than most of you reading this. Having cash isn’t my goal. My goal is to change the direction of my family tree for these little guys and their kids.

I’ve spent the last five years working to improve my financial education. Here’s what I’ve learned about money:
<ol>
 	<li>Don’t sit on cash. Deploy it.</li>
 	<li>Cash is a tool used to build things</li>
 	<li>Buy cash producing assets, not toys</li>
 	<li>Build wealth, not bank accounts</li>
 	<li>Use other people’s money</li>
 	<li>Think long term</li>

19775,"Did a SC politician end world hunger...with a tweet?","As a South Carolinian, I’ve followed our former Governor David Beasley for years. If you would have told me that he would become the world’s most successful fundraiser, I would have told you that you’re crazy. But here we are.

By any standard, when you look at the effort to dollar ratio, I don’t know if anyone has ever raised so much money with so little effort.

With just a few tweets that took minutes to write and send, Beasley, now Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Programme, raised nearly $6 billion to end world hunger.

Here’s how it went down:

Beasley entered into a Twitter feud with everyone’s favorite eccentric billionaire, Elon Musk, when he asserted that instead of focusing on space, Musk, Bezos and Branson should focus on solving Earth’s problems, specifically world hunger. He claimed it would take $6 billion.

Musk responded and asked for details. He tweeted, “Please publish your current &amp; proposed spending in detail so people can see exactly where money goes. Sunlight is a wonderful thing.”

The back and forth continued for awhile and then it all went silent. We don’t know exactly what happened behind the scenes, but last week it was reported that Elon Musk donated $5.7 billion in Tesla stock to a charity for world hunger.

Details are still unclear, but it’s looking like David Beasley may have ended world hunger with a few tweets.

19777,"The Workout We All Need","If you are attacking our leaders as weak but aren’t putting in the time to strengthen yourself, then you are part of the problem.

Our leaders come from our communities. Our communities are a reflection of the individual.

Weak people = weak leaders = weak America.

Despite the many voices in politics, there should be no question as to what we are all working towards.

Strong leaders + Strong communities = A stronger America. For everyone.

It's a hard concept to assess but it doesn't have to be.

Strengthen your mind.

Strengthen your body.

Strengthen your home.

Strengthen your community.

That will strengthen our nation.

Comfort has destroyed America.

We became woke because we didn’t have real shit to worry about.

19781,"Fall Seven Times, Get Up Eight","<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Ikigai-Japanese-Secret-Long-Happy/dp/0143130722"">Ikigai: The Japanese Secret To A Long and Happy Life</a>

This review is a bit different. I wrote it as a letter to a specific person.

------------------------------

Yesterday when I told you about an article coming out mentioning a subpoena I recently received, you asked “how do you let these things just roll off your back?” I responded “I have calloused my brain by enduring much harder things.”

I finished “Ikigai: The Japanese Secret To A Long and Happy Life” after our conversation. The last chapter is all about this very topic - resilience and anti- fragility. I suggest you read it.

The authors wrote:

“Resilience isn’t just the ability to persevere. It’s also an outlook we can cultivate to stay focused on the important things in life rather than what is most urgent and keep ourselves from being carried away by negative emotions… We will explore techniques that go beyond resilience to cultivate anti-fragility. Sooner or later we all have to face difficult moments and the way we do this can make a huge difference to our quality of life. Proper training for our mind, body and emotional resilience is essential for confronting life’s ups and downs. Fall seven times, get up eight.”

So how do you cultivate anti-fragility? You do hard things. Let me give you a real life example.

This weekend I am taking on the David Goggins 4 x 4 x 48 challenge. I will be running 4 miles every 4 hours for 48 hours. The miles are hard. The sleep deprivation is harder.

Why do this? I’m not getting a medal. I’m not doing it with anyone else. I’m doing it because it’s hard and I haven’t had a race in three months. I need to constantly do hard things to prepare my mind and body for stress. I must become anti-fragile.
Anti-fragility is only a small part of this book about happiness and longevity. The authors have studied the communities that live the longest, especially those of Japan, and have come up with ten rules to live and long and happy life:
<ol>
 	<li>Stay active and do not retire</li>
 	<li>Take it slow</li>
 	<li>Do not fill your stomach</li>
 	<li>Surround yourself with good friends</li>
 	<li>Get in shape</li>
 	<li>Smile</li>
 	<li>Reconnect with nature</li>
 	<li>Give thanks</li>
 	<li>Live in the moment</li>
 	<li>Follow your passion</li>
</ol>
I loved this book. It’s the most compact summary I’ve found for living a well-rounded life. Be focused. Be successful. Be happier. Live longer. I think you’ll love it too.
